<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>Just as a little child holds out its hands to catch the
sunbeams, to feel and to grasp what, so its eyes tell it,
is actually there, so, down through the ages, men have
stretched out their hands in eager endeavour to know
their God. And because only through the human was
the divine knowable, the old peoples of the earth made
gods of their heroes and not unfrequently endowed
these gods with as many of the vices as of the
virtues of their worshippers. As we read the myths of
the East and the West we find ever the same story.
That portion of the ancient Aryan race which poured
from the central plain of Asia, through the rocky defiles
of what we now call &ldquo;The Frontier,&rdquo; to populate the
fertile lowlands of India, had gods who must once have
been wholly heroic, but who came in time to be more
degraded than the most vicious of lustful criminals.
And the Greeks, Latins, Teutons, Celts, and Slavonians,
who came of the same mighty Aryan stock, did even as
those with whom they owned a common ancestry.
Originally they gave to their gods of their best. All
that was noblest in them, all that was strongest and
most selfless, all the higher instincts of their natures
were their endowment. And although their worship
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg&nbsp;viii]</a></span>
in time became corrupt and lost its beauty, there yet
remains for us, in the old tales of the gods, a wonderful
humanity that strikes a vibrant chord in the hearts
of those who are the descendants of their worshippers.
For though creeds and forms may change, human nature
never changes. We are less simple than our fathers:
that is all. And, as Professor York Powell<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> most truly
says: &ldquo;It is not in a man&rsquo;s creed, but in his deeds;
not in his knowledge, but in his sympathy, that there
lies the essence of what is good and of what will last in
human life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The most usual habits of mind in our own day are
the theoretical and analytical habits. Dissection, vivisection,
analysis&mdash;those are the processes to which
all things not conclusively historical and all things
spiritual are bound to pass. Thus we find the old
myths classified into Sun Myths and Dawn Myths,
Earth Myths and Moon Myths, Fire Myths and Wind
Myths, until, as one of the most sane and vigorous
thinkers of the present day<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> has justly observed: &ldquo;If
you take the rhyme of Mary and her little lamb, and call
Mary the sun and the lamb the moon, you will achieve
astonishing results, both in religion and astronomy,
when you find that the lamb followed Mary to school
one day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In this little collection of Myths, the stories are not
presented to the student of folklore as a fresh contribution
to his knowledge. Rather is the book intended
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg&nbsp;ix]</a></span>
for those who, in the course of their reading, frequently
come across names which possess for them no meaning,
and who care to read some old stories, through which
runs the same humanity that their own hearts know.
For although the old worship has passed away, it is
almost impossible for us to open a book that does not
contain some mention of the gods of long ago. In our
childhood we are given copies of Kingsley&rsquo;s <i>Heroes</i> and
of Hawthorne&rsquo;s <i>Tanglewood Tales</i>. Later on, we find in
Shakespeare, Spenser, Milton, Keats, Shelley, Longfellow,
Tennyson, Mrs. Browning, and a host of other
writers, constant allusion to the stories of the gods.
Scarcely a poet has ever written but makes mention
of them in one or other of his poems. It would seem
as if there were no get-away from them. We might
expect in this twentieth century that the old gods of
Greece and of Rome, the gods of our Northern forefathers,
the gods of Egypt, the gods of the British race,
might be forgotten. But even when we read in a newspaper
of aeroplanes, someone is more than likely to quote
the story of Bellerophon and his winged steed, or of
Icarus, the flyer, and in our daily speech the names of
gods and goddesses continually crop up. We drive&mdash;or,
at least, till lately we drove&mdash;in Phaetons. Not only
schoolboys swear by Jove or by Jupiter. The silvery
substance in our thermometers and barometers is
named Mercury. Blacksmiths are accustomed to being
referred to as &ldquo;sons of Vulcan,&rdquo; and beautiful youths
to being called &ldquo;young Adonises.&rdquo; We accept the
names of newspapers and debating societies as being
the &ldquo;Argus,&rdquo; without perhaps quite realising who was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg&nbsp;x]</a></span>
Argus, the many-eyed. We talk of &ldquo;a panic,&rdquo; and
forget that the great god Pan is father of the word.
Even in our religious services we go back to heathenism.
Not only are the crockets on our cathedral spires
and church pews remnants of fire-worship, but one of
our own most beautiful Christian blessings is probably
of Assyrian origin. &ldquo;The Lord bless thee and keep
thee.... The Lord make His face to shine upon
thee.... The Lord lift up the light of His countenance
upon thee....&rdquo; So did the priests of the sun-gods
invoke blessings upon those who worshipped.</p>

<p>We make many discoveries as we study the myths
of the North and of the South. In the story of Baldur
we find that the goddess Hel ultimately gave her name
to the place of punishment precious to the Calvinistic
mind. And because the Norseman very much disliked
the bitter, cruel cold of the long winter, his heaven
was a warm, well-fired abode, and his place of punishment
one of terrible frigidity. Somewhere on the other
side of the Tweed and Cheviots was the spot selected
by the Celt of southern Britain. On the other hand,
the eastern mind, which knew the terrors of a sun-smitten
land and of a heat that was torture, had for a hell a
fiery place of constantly burning flames.</p>

<p>In the space permitted, it has not been possible to
deal with more than a small number of myths, and the
well-known stories of Herakles, of Theseus, and of the
Argonauts have been purposely omitted. These have
been so perfectly told by great writers that to retell
them would seem absurd. The same applies to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg&nbsp;xi]</a></span>
Odyssey and the Iliad, the translations of which probably
take rank amongst the finest translations in any
language.</p>

<p>The writer will feel that her object has been gained
should any readers of these stories feel that for a little
while they have left the toilful utilitarianism of the
present day behind them, and, with it, its hampering
restrictions of sordid actualities that are so murderous
to imagination and to all romance.</p>

<h3>POSTSCRIPT</h3>

<p>We have come, in those last long months, to date our happenings as
they have never until now been dated by those of our own generation.</p>

<p>We speak of things that took place &ldquo;<em>Before the War</em>&rdquo;; and between
that time and this stands a barrier immeasurable.</p>

<p>This book, with its Preface, was completed in 1914&mdash;&ldquo;<em>Before the
War.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Since August 1914 the finest humanity of our race has been enduring
Promethean agonies. But even as Prometheus unflinchingly bore the
cruelties of pain, of heat and of cold, of hunger and of thirst, and the
tortures inflicted by an obscene bird of prey, so have endured the men
of our nation and of those nations with whom we are proud to be allied.
Much more remote than they seemed one little year ago, now seem the
old stories of sunny Greece. But if we have studied the strange transmogrification
of the ancient gods, we can look with interest, if with
horror, at the Teuton representation of the <span class="smcap">God</span> in whom we believe as
a <span class="smcap">God</span> of perfect purity, of honour, and of love. According to their
interpretation of Him, the God of the Huns would seem to be as much
a confederate of the vicious as the most degraded god of ancient worship.
And if we turn with shame from the Divinity so often and so glibly
referred to by blasphemous lips, and look on a picture that tears our
hearts, and yet makes our hearts big with pride, we can understand how
it was that those heroes who fought and died in the Valley of the
Scamander came in time to be regarded not as men, but as gods.</p>

<p>There is no tale in all the world&rsquo;s mythology finer than the tale that
began in August 1914. How future generations will tell the tale, who
can say?</p>

<p>But we, for whom Life can never be the same again, can say with all
earnestness: &ldquo;It is the memory that the soldier leaves behind him, like
the long train of light that follows the sunken sun&mdash;that is all which is
worth caring for, which distinguishes the death of the brave or the
ignoble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, surely, to all those who are fighting, and suffering, and dying
for a noble cause, the <span class="smcap">God</span> of gods, the <span class="smcap">God</span> of battles, who is also the
<span class="smcap">God</span> of peace, and the <span class="smcap">God</span> of Love, has become an ever near and
eternally living entity.</p>

<h1 style="padding-bottom: 3em;">A BOOK OF MYTHS</h1>



<h2>PROMETHEUS AND PANDORA</h2>


<p>Those who are interested in watching the mental development
of a child must have noted that when the
baby has learned to speak even a little, it begins to show
its growing intelligence by asking questions. &ldquo;What
is this?&rdquo; it would seem at first to ask with regard to
simple things that to it are still mysteries. Soon it
arrives at the more far-reaching inquiries&mdash;&ldquo;Why is
this so?&rdquo; &ldquo;How did this happen?&rdquo; And as the
child&rsquo;s mental growth continues, the painstaking and
conscientious parent or guardian is many times faced by
questions which lack of knowledge, or a sensitive honesty,
prevents him from answering either with assurance or
with ingenuity.</p>

<p>As with the child, so it has ever been with the human
race. Man has always come into the world asking
&ldquo;How?&rdquo; &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; &ldquo;What?&rdquo; and so the Hebrew,
the Greek, the Maori, the Australian blackfellow, the
Norseman&mdash;in a word, each race of mankind&mdash;has formed
for itself an explanation of existence, an answer to the
questions of the groping child-mind&mdash;&ldquo;Who made the
world?&rdquo; &ldquo;What is God?&rdquo; &ldquo;What made a God
think of fire and air and water?&rdquo; &ldquo;Why am I, <em>I</em>?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg&nbsp;2]</a></span>
Into the explanation of creation and existence given
by the Greeks come the stories of Prometheus and of
Pandora. The world, as first it was, to the Greeks was
such a world as the one of which we read in the Book
of Genesis&mdash;&ldquo;without form, and void.&rdquo; It was a sunless
world in which land, air, and sea were mixed up together,
and over which reigned a deity called Chaos.
With him ruled the goddess of Night and their son was
Erebus, god of Darkness. When the two beautiful children
of Erebus, Light and Day, had flooded formless
space with their radiance, Eros, the god of Love, was
born, and Light and Day and Love, working together,
turned discord into harmony and made the earth, the sea,
and the sky into one perfect whole. A giant race, a race
of Titans, in time populated this newly-made earth, and
of these one of the mightiest was Prometheus. To him,
and to his brother Epimethus, was entrusted by Eros the
distribution of the gifts of faculties and of instincts to all
the living creatures in the world, and the task of making
a creature lower than the gods, something less great than
the Titans, yet in knowledge and in understanding infinitely
higher than the beasts and birds and fishes. At
the hands of the Titan brothers, birds, beasts, and fishes
had fared handsomely. They were Titanic in their
generosity, and so prodigal had they been in their gifts
that when they would fain have carried out the commands
of Eros they found that nothing was left for the equipment
of this being, to be called Man. Yet, nothing
daunted, Prometheus took some clay from the ground
at his feet, moistened it with water, and fashioned it into
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg&nbsp;3]</a></span>
an image, in form like the gods. Into its nostrils Eros
breathed the spirit of life, Pallas Athen&eacute; endowed it with
a soul, and the first man looked wonderingly round on
the earth that was to be his heritage. Prometheus,
proud of the beautiful thing of his own creation, would
fain have given Man a worthy gift, but no gift remained
for him. He was naked, unprotected, more helpless than
any of the beasts of the field, more to be pitied than any
of them in that he had a soul to suffer.</p>

<p>Surely Zeus, the All Powerful, ruler of Olympus, would
have compassion on Man? But Prometheus looked to
Zeus in vain; compassion he had none. Then, in infinite
pity, Prometheus bethought himself of a power
belonging to the gods alone and unshared by any living
creature on the earth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall give Fire to the Man whom we have made,&rdquo;
he said to Epimethus. To Epimethus this seemed an
impossibility, but to Prometheus nothing was impossible.
He bided his time and, unseen by the gods, he made his
way into Olympus, lighted a hollow torch with a spark
from the chariot of the Sun and hastened back to earth
with this royal gift to Man. Assuredly no other gift
could have brought him more completely the empire
that has since been his. No longer did he tremble and
cower in the darkness of caves when Zeus hurled his
lightnings across the sky. No more did he dread the
animals that hunted him and drove him in terror before
them.</p>

<p>Armed with fire, the beasts became his vassals. With
fire he forged weapons, defied the frost and cold, coined
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg&nbsp;4]</a></span>
money, made implements for tillage, introduced the arts,
and was able to destroy as well as to create.</p>

<p>From his throne on Olympus, Zeus looked down on
the earth and saw, with wonder, airy columns of blue-grey
smoke that curled upwards to the sky. He watched
more closely, and realised with terrible wrath that the
moving flowers of red and gold that he saw in that land
that the Titans shared with men, came from fire, that had
hitherto been the gods&rsquo; own sacred power. Speedily he
assembled a council of the gods to mete out to Prometheus
a punishment fit for the blasphemous daring of his crime.
This council decided at length to create a thing that
should for evermore charm the souls and hearts of men,
and yet, for evermore, be man&rsquo;s undoing.</p>

<p>To Vulcan, god of fire, whose province Prometheus had
insulted, was given the work of fashioning out of clay
and water the creature by which the honour of the gods
was to be avenged. &ldquo;The lame Vulcan,&rdquo; says Hesiod,
poet of Greek mythology, &ldquo;formed out of the earth an
image resembling a chaste virgin. Pallas Athen&eacute;, of the
blue eyes, hastened to ornament her and to robe her in a
white tunic. She dressed on the crown of her head a
long veil, skilfully fashioned and admirable to see; she
crowned her forehead with graceful garlands of newly-opened
flowers and a golden diadem that the lame Vulcan,
the illustrious god, had made with his own hands to
please the puissant Jove. On this crown Vulcan had
chiselled the innumerable animals that the continents
and the sea nourish in their bosoms, all endowed with a
marvellous grace and apparently alive. When he had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg&nbsp;5]</a></span>
finally completed, instead of some useful work, this illustrious
masterpiece, he brought into the assembly this
virgin, proud of the ornaments with which she had been
decked by the blue-eyed goddess, daughter of a powerful
sire.&rdquo; To this beautiful creature, destined by the gods
to be man&rsquo;s destroyer, each of them gave a gift. From
Aphrodite she got beauty, from Apollo music, from Hermes
the gift of a winning tongue. And when all that great
company in Olympus had bestowed their gifts, they named
the woman Pandora&mdash;&ldquo;Gifted by all the Gods.&rdquo; Thus
equipped for victory, Pandora was led by Hermes to the
world that was thenceforward to be her home. As a
gift from the gods she was presented to Prometheus.</p>

<p>But Prometheus, gazing in wonder at the violet blue
eyes bestowed by Aphrodite, that looked wonderingly back
into his own as if they were indeed as innocent as two
violets wet with the morning dew, hardened his great
heart, and would have none of her. As a hero&mdash;a worthy
descendant of Titans&mdash;said in later years, &ldquo;Timeo
Danaos et dona ferentes,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I fear the Greeks, even
when they bring gifts.&rdquo; And Prometheus, the greatly-daring,
knowing that he merited the anger of the gods,
saw treachery in a gift outwardly so perfect. Not only
would he not accept this exquisite creature for his own,
but he hastened to caution his brother also to refuse her.</p>

<p>But well were they named Prometheus (Forethought)
and Epimethus (Afterthought). For Epimethus it
was enough to look at this peerless woman, sent
from the gods, for him to love her and to believe in
her utterly. She was the fairest thing on earth,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg&nbsp;6]</a></span>
worthy indeed of the deathless gods who had created her.
Perfect, too, was the happiness that she brought with
her to Epimethus. Before her coming, as he well knew
now, the fair world had been incomplete. Since she came
the fragrant flowers had grown more sweet for him, the
song of the birds more full of melody. He found new life
in Pandora and marvelled how his brother could ever
have fancied that she could bring to the world aught but
peace and joyousness.</p>

<p>Now when the gods had entrusted to the Titan
brothers the endowment of all living things upon the
earth, they had been careful to withhold everything
that might bring into the world pain, sickness, anxiety,
bitterness of heart, remorse, or soul-crushing sorrow. All
these hurtful things were imprisoned in a coffer which was
given into the care of the trusty Epimethus.</p>

<p>To Pandora the world into which she came was all
fresh, all new, quite full of unexpected joys and delightful
surprises. It was a world of mystery, but mystery
of which her great, adoring, simple Titan held the golden
key. When she saw the coffer which never was opened,
what then more natural than that she should ask Epimethus
what it contained? But the contents were known
only to the gods. Epimethus was unable to answer.
Day by day, the curiosity of Pandora increased. To her
the gods had never given anything but good. Surely
there must be here gifts more precious still. What if the
Olympians had destined her to be the one to open the
casket, and had sent her to earth in order that she might
bestow on this dear world, on the men who lived on it,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg&nbsp;7]</a></span>
and on her own magnificent Titan, happiness and blessings
which only the minds of gods could have conceived?
Thus did there come a day when Pandora, unconscious
instrument in the hands of a vengeful Olympian, in all
faith, and with the courage that is born of faith and of
love, opened the lid of the prison-house of evil. And as
from coffers in the old Egyptian tombs, the live plague
can still rush forth and slay, the long-imprisoned evils
rushed forth upon the fair earth and on the human beings
who lived on it&mdash;malignant, ruthless, fierce, treacherous,
and cruel&mdash;poisoning, slaying, devouring. Plague and
pestilence and murder, envy and malice and revenge and
all viciousness&mdash;an ugly wolf-pack indeed was that one
let loose by Pandora. Terror, doubt, misery, had all
rushed straightway to attack her heart, while the evils of
which she had never dreamed stung mind and soul into
dismay and horror, when, by hastily shutting the lid of
the coffer, she tried to undo the evil she had done.</p>

<p>And lo, she found that the gods had imprisoned one good
gift only in this Inferno of horrors and of ugliness. In
the world there had never been any need of Hope. What
work was there for Hope to do where all was perfect, and
where each creature possessed the desire of body and of
heart? Therefore Hope was thrust into the chest that
held the evils, a star in a black night, a lily growing on a
dung-heap. And as Pandora, white-lipped and trembling,
looked into the otherwise empty box, courage came back
to her heart, and Epimethus let fall to his side the arm
that would have slain the woman of his love because there
came to him, like a draught of wine to a warrior spent in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg&nbsp;8]</a></span>
battle, an imperial vision of the sons of men through all
the aeons to come, combatting all evils of body and of
soul, going on conquering and to conquer. Thus, saved
by Hope, the Titan and the woman faced the future, and
for them the vengeance of the gods was stayed.</p>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i9">&ldquo;Yet I argue not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against Heav&rsquo;n&rsquo;s hand or will, nor bate a jot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of heart or hope; but still bear up and steer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Right onward.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>So spoke Milton, the blind Titan of the seventeenth
century; and Shakespeare says:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;True hope is swift, and flies with swallow&rsquo;s wings;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kings it makes gods, and meaner creatures kings.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Upon the earth, and on the children of men who were
as gods in their knowledge and mastery of the force of
fire, Jupiter had had his revenge. For Prometheus he
reserved another punishment. He, the greatly-daring,
once the dear friend and companion of Zeus himself, was
chained to a rock on Mount Caucasus by the vindictive
deity. There, on a dizzy height, his body thrust against
the sun-baked rock, Prometheus had to endure the torment
of having a foul-beaked vulture tear out his liver,
as though he were a piece of carrion lying on the mountain
side. All day, while the sun mercilessly smote him and the
blue sky turned from red to black before his pain-racked
eyes, the torture went on. Each night, when the filthy
bird of prey that worked the will of the gods spread its
dark wings and flew back to its eyrie, the Titan endured
the cruel mercy of having his body grow whole once more.
But with daybreak there came again the silent shadow,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg&nbsp;9]</a></span>
the smell of the unclean thing, and again with fierce beak
and talons the vulture greedily began its work.</p>

<p>Thirty thousand years was the time of his sentence, and
yet Prometheus knew that at any moment he could have
brought his torment to an end. A secret was his&mdash;a
mighty secret, the revelation of which would have brought
him the mercy of Zeus and have reinstated him in the
favour of the all-powerful god. Yet did he prefer to
endure his agonies rather than to free himself by bowing
to the desires of a tyrant who had caused Man to be made,
yet denied to Man those gifts that made him nobler than
the beasts and raised him almost to the heights of the
Olympians. Thus for him the weary centuries dragged by&mdash;in
suffering that knew no respite&mdash;in endurance that
the gods might have ended. Prometheus had brought
an imperial gift to the men that he had made, and imperially
he paid the penalty.</p>

<h2>PYGMALION</h2>


<p>In days when the world was young and when the gods
walked on the earth, there reigned over the island of
Cyprus a sculptor-king, and king of sculptors, named
Pygmalion. In the language of our own day, we should
call him &ldquo;wedded to his art.&rdquo; In woman he only saw
the bane of man. Women, he believed, lured men from
the paths to which their destiny called them. While
man walked alone, he walked free&mdash;he had given no
&ldquo;hostages to fortune.&rdquo; Alone, man could live for his
art, could combat every danger that beset him, could
escape, unhampered, from every pitfall in life. But
woman was the ivy that clings to the oak, and throttles
the oak in the end. No woman, vowed Pygmalion,
should ever hamper him. And so at length he came to
hate women, and, free of heart and mind, his genius
wrought such great things that he became a very perfect
sculptor. He had one passion, a passion for his art, and
that sufficed him. Out of great rough blocks of marble he
would hew the most perfect semblance of men and of
women, and of everything that seemed to him most beautiful
and the most worth preserving.</p>

<p>When we look now at the Venus of Milo, at the Diana of
Versailles, and at the Apollo Belvidere in the Vatican, we
can imagine what were the greater things that the sculptor
of Cyprus freed from the dead blocks of marble. One
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg&nbsp;12]</a></span>
day as he chipped and chiselled there came to him, like
the rough sketch of a great picture, the semblance of a
woman. How it came he knew not. Only he knew that
in that great mass of pure white stone there seemed to be
imprisoned the exquisite image of a woman, a woman
that he must set free. Slowly, gradually, the woman
came. Soon he knew that she was the most beautiful
thing that his art had ever wrought. All that he had
ever thought that a woman <em>should</em> be, this woman was.
Her form and features were all most perfect, and so perfect
were they, that he felt very sure that, had she been
a woman indeed, most perfect would have been the soul
within. For her he worked as he had never worked
before. There came, at last, a day when he felt that
another touch would be insult to the exquisite thing he
had created. He laid his chisel aside and sat down to
gaze at the Perfect Woman. She seemed to gaze back at
him. Her parted lips were ready to speak&mdash;to smile.
Her hands were held out to hold his hands. Then Pygmalion
covered his eyes. He, the hater of women, loved
a woman&mdash;a woman of chilly marble. The women he
had scorned were avenged.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 276px;">

<img src="images/abom05th.jpg" width="276" height="400"
alt="" /></a>
<span class="caption">THEN PYGMALION COVERED HIS EYES</span>
</div>

<p>Day by day his passion for the woman of his own
creation grew and grew. His hands no longer wielded
the chisel. They grew idle. He would stand under the
great pines and gaze across the sapphire-blue sea, and
dream strange dreams of a marble woman who walked
across the waves with arms outstretched, with smiling
lips, and who became a woman of warm flesh and blood
when her bare feet touched the yellow sand, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg&nbsp;13]</a></span>
the bright sun of Cyprus touched her marble hair and
turned it into hair of living gold. Then he would
hasten back to his studio to find the miracle still unaccomplished,
and would passionately kiss the little cold
hands, and lay beside the little cold feet the presents he
knew that young girls loved&mdash;bright shells and exquisite
precious stones, gorgeous-hued birds and fragrant flowers,
shining amber, and beads that sparkled and flashed with
all the most lovely combinations of colour that the mind
of artist could devise. Yet more he did, for he spent vast
sums on priceless pearls and hung them in her ears and
upon her cold white breast; and the merchants wondered
who could be the one upon whom Pygmalion lavished the
money from his treasury.</p>

<p>To his divinity he gave a name&mdash;&ldquo;Galatea&rdquo;; and
always on still nights the myriad silver stars would seem
to breathe to him &ldquo;Galatea&rdquo; ... and on those days
when the tempests blew across the sandy wastes of Arabia
and churned up the fierce white surf on the rocks of
Cyprus, the very spirit of the storm seemed to moan
through the crash of waves in longing, hopeless and unutterable&mdash;&ldquo;Galatea!...
Galatea!...&rdquo; For her he decked a
couch with Tyrian purple, and on the softest of pillows he
laid the beautiful head of the marble woman that he loved.</p>

<p>So the time wore on until the festival of Aphrodite
drew near. Smoke from many altars curled out to sea, the
odour of incense mingled with the fragrance of the great
pine trees, and garlanded victims lowed and bleated as
they were led to the sacrifice. As the leader of his people,
Pygmalion faithfully and perfectly performed all his part
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg&nbsp;14]</a></span>
in the solemnities and at last he was left beside the altar
to pray alone. Never before had his words faltered as he
laid his petitions before the gods, but on this day he spoke
not as a sculptor-king, but as a child who was half afraid
of what he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O Aphrodite!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;who can do all things, give
me, I pray you, one like my Galatea for my wife!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give me my Galatea,&rdquo; he dared not say; but Aphrodite
knew well the words he would fain have uttered, and
smiled to think how Pygmalion at last was on his knees.
In token that his prayer was answered, three times she
made the flames on the altar shoot up in a fiery point,
and Pygmalion went home, scarcely daring to hope, not
allowing his gladness to conquer his fear.</p>

<p>The shadows of evening were falling as he went into
the room that he had made sacred to Galatea. On the
purple-covered couch she lay, and as he entered it seemed
as though she met his eyes with her own; almost it
seemed that she smiled at him in welcome. He quickly
went up to her and, kneeling by her side, he pressed
his lips on those lips of chilly marble. So many times
he had done it before, and always it was as though
the icy lips that could never live sent their chill right
through his heart, but now it surely seemed to him
that the lips were cold no longer. He felt one of the
little hands, and no more did it remain heavy and cold
and stiff in his touch, but lay in his own hand, soft
and living and warm. He softly laid his fingers on the
marble hair, and lo, it was the soft and wavy burnished
golden hair of his desire. Again, reverently as he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg&nbsp;15]</a></span>
had laid his offerings that day on the altar of Venus,
Pygmalion kissed her lips. And then did Galatea, with
warm and rosy cheeks, widely open her eyes, like pools in
a dark mountain stream on which the sun is shining, and
gaze with timid gladness into his own.</p>

<p>There are no after tales of Pygmalion and Galatea.
We only know that their lives were happy and that to
them was born a son, Paphos, from whom the city sacred
to Aphrodite received its name. Perhaps Aphrodite may
have smiled sometimes to watch Pygmalion, once the
scorner of women, the adoring servant of the woman that
his own hands had first designed.</p>

<h2>PHAETON</h2>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;The road, to drive on which unskilled were Phaeton&rsquo;s hands.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Dante</span>&mdash;<i>Purgatorio</i>.</p>


<p>To Apollo, the sun-god, and Clymene, a beautiful ocean-nymph,
there was born in the pleasant land of Greece a
child to whom was given the name of Phaeton, the Bright
and Shining One. The rays of the sun seemed to live in
the curls of the fearless little lad, and when at noon other
children would seek the cool shade of the cypress groves,
Phaeton would hold his head aloft and gaze fearlessly up
at the brazen sky from whence fierce heat beat down upon
his golden head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Behold, my father drives his chariot across the
heavens!&rdquo; he proudly proclaimed. &ldquo;In a little while I,
also, will drive the four snow-white steeds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His elders heard the childish boast with a smile, but
when Epaphos, half-brother to Apollo, had listened to it
many times and beheld the child, Phaeton, grow into an
arrogant lad who held himself as though he were indeed
one of the Immortals, anger grew in his heart. One day
he turned upon Phaeton and spoke in fierce scorn:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dost say thou art son of a god? A shameless
boaster and a liar art thou! Hast ever spoken to thy
divine sire? Give us some proof of thy sonship! No more
child of the glorious Apollo art thou than are the vermin
his children, that the sun breeds in the dust at my feet.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg&nbsp;17]</a></span>
For a moment, before the cruel taunt, the lad was
stricken into silence, and then, his pride aflame, his young
voice shaking with rage and with bitter shame, he cried
aloud: &ldquo;Thou, Epaphos, art the liar. I have but to ask
my father, and thou shalt see me drive his golden chariot
across the sky.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To his mother he hastened, to get balm for his hurt
pride, as many a time he had got it for the little bodily
wounds of childhood, and with bursting heart he poured
forth his story.</p>

<p>&ldquo;True it is,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that my father has never
deigned to speak to me. Yet I know, because thou hast
told me so, that he is my sire. And now my word is
pledged. Apollo must let me drive his steeds, else I
am for evermore branded braggart and liar, and shamed
amongst men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Clymene listened with grief to his complaint. He
was so young, so gallant, so foolish.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Truly thou art the son of Apollo,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and
oh, son of my heart, thy beauty is his, and thy pride the
pride of a son of the gods. Yet only partly a god art
thou, and though thy proud courage would dare all things,
it were mad folly to think of doing what a god alone
can do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But at last she said to him, &ldquo;Naught that I can say
is of any avail. Go, seek thy father, and ask him what
thou wilt.&rdquo; Then she told him how he might find the
place in the east where Apollo rested ere the labours of
the day began, and with eager gladness Phaeton set out
upon his journey. A long way he travelled, with never
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg&nbsp;18]</a></span>
a stop, yet when the glittering dome and jewelled turrets
and minarets of the Palace of the Sun came into view, he
forgot his weariness and hastened up the steep ascent to
the home of his father.</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;bus Apollo, clad in purple that glowed like the
radiance of a cloud in the sunset sky, sat upon his
golden throne. The Day, the Month, and the Year
stood by him, and beside them were the Hours. Spring
was there, her head wreathed with flowers; Summer,
crowned with ripened grain; Autumn, with his feet
empurpled by the juice of the grapes; and Winter,
with hair all white and stiff with hoar-frost. And when
Phaeton walked up the golden steps that led to his
father&rsquo;s throne, it seemed as though incarnate Youth had
come to join the court of the god of the Sun, and that
Youth was so beautiful a thing that it must surely live
forever. Proudly did Apollo know him for his son,
and when the boy looked in his eyes with the arrogant
fearlessness of boyhood, the god greeted him kindly
and asked him to tell him why he came, and what
was his petition.</p>

<p>As to Clymene, so also to Apollo, Phaeton told his
tale, and his father listened, half in pride and amusement,
half in puzzled vexation. When the boy stopped, and
then breathlessly, with shining eyes and flushed cheeks,
ended up his story with: &ldquo;And, O light of the boundless
world, if I am indeed thy son, let it be as I have said, and for
one day only let me drive thy chariot across the heavens!&rdquo;
Apollo shook his head and answered very gravely:</p>

<p>&ldquo;In truth thou art my dear son,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg&nbsp;19]</a></span>
the dreadful Styx, the river of the dead, I swear that I will
give thee any gift that thou dost name and that will give
proof that thy father is the immortal Apollo. But never
to thee nor to any other, be he mortal or immortal, shall
I grant the boon of driving my chariot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the boy pled on:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am shamed for ever, my father,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Surely
thou wouldst not have son of thine proved liar and
braggart?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not even the gods themselves can do this thing,&rdquo;
answered Apollo. &ldquo;Nay, not even the almighty Zeus.
None but I, Ph&oelig;bus Apollo, may drive the flaming chariot
of the sun, for the way is beset with dangers and none
know it but I.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only tell me the way, my father!&rdquo; cried Phaeton.
&ldquo;So soon I could learn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Half in sadness, Apollo smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The first part of the way is uphill,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;So
steep it is that only very slowly can my horses climb it.
High in the heavens is the middle, so high that even I
grow dizzy when I look down upon the earth and the sea.
And the last piece of the way is a precipice that rushes
so steeply downward that my hands can scarce check
the mad rush of my galloping horses. And all the while,
the heaven is spinning round, and the stars with it. By
the horns of the Bull I have to drive, past the Archer whose
bow is taut and ready to slay, close to where the Scorpion
stretches out its arms and the great Crab&rsquo;s claws
grope for a prey....&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fear none of these things, oh my father!&rdquo; cried
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg&nbsp;20]</a></span>
Phaeton. &ldquo;Grant that for one day only I drive thy
white-maned steeds!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Very pitifully Apollo looked at him, and for a little
space he was silent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The little human hands,&rdquo; he said at length, &ldquo;the
little human frame!&mdash;and with them the soul of a god.
The pity of it, my son. Dost not know that the boon
that thou dost crave from me is Death?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rather Death than Dishonour,&rdquo; said Phaeton, and
proudly he added, &ldquo;For once would I drive like the god,
my father. I have no fear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So was Apollo vanquished, and Phaeton gained his
heart&rsquo;s desire.</p>

<p>From the courtyard of the Palace the four white
horses were led, and they pawed the air and neighed aloud
in the glory of their strength. They drew the chariot
whose axle and pole and wheels were of gold, with spokes
of silver, while inside were rows of diamonds and of
chrysolites that gave dazzling reflection of the sun. Then
Apollo anointed the face of Phaeton with a powerful
essence that might keep him from being smitten by the
flames, and upon his head he placed the rays of the sun.
And then the stars went away, even to the Daystar that
went last of all, and, at Apollo&rsquo;s signal, Aurora, the rosy-fingered,
threw open the purple gates of the east, and
Phaeton saw a path of pale rose-colour open before him.</p>

<p>With a cry of exultation, the boy leapt into the
chariot and laid hold of the golden reins. Barely did he
hear Apollo&rsquo;s parting words: &ldquo;Hold fast the reins, and
spare the whip. All thy strength will be wanted to hold
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg&nbsp;21]</a></span>
the horses in. Go not too high nor too low. The middle
course is safest and best. Follow, if thou canst, in the
old tracks of my chariot wheels!&rdquo; His glad voice of
thanks for the godlike boon rang back to where Apollo
stood and watched him vanishing into the dawn that still
was soft in hue as the feathers on the breast of a dove.</p>

<p>Uphill at first the white steeds made their way, and
the fire from their nostrils tinged with flame-colour the
dark clouds that hung over the land and the sea. With
rapture, Phaeton felt that truly he was the son of a god,
and that at length he was enjoying his heritage. The
day for which, through all his short life, he had longed,
had come at last. He was driving the chariot whose
progress even now was awaking the sleeping earth. The
radiance from its wheels and from the rays he wore round
his head was painting the clouds, and he laughed aloud
in rapture as he saw, far down below, the sea and the
rivers he had bathed in as a human boy, mirroring the
green and rose and purple, and gold and silver, and fierce
crimson, that he, Phaeton, was placing in the sky. The
grey mist rolled from the mountain tops at his desire. The
white fog rolled up from the valleys. All living things
awoke; the flowers opened their petals; the grain grew
golden; the fruit grew ripe. Could but Epaphos see him
now! Surely he must see him, and realise that not
Apollo but Phaeton was guiding the horses of his father,
driving the chariot of the Sun.</p>

<p>Quicker and yet more quick grew the pace of the
white-maned steeds. Soon they left the morning breezes
behind, and very soon they knew that these were not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg&nbsp;22]</a></span>
the hands of the god, their master, that held the golden
reins. Like an air-ship without its accustomed ballast,
the chariot rolled unsteadily, and not only the boy&rsquo;s light
weight but his light hold on their bridles made them grow
mad with a lust for speed. The white foam flew from
their mouths like the spume from the giant waves of a
furious sea, and their pace was swift as that of a bolt
that is cast by the arm of Zeus.</p>

<p>Yet Phaeton had no fear, and when they heard
him shout in rapture, &ldquo;Quicker still, brave ones! more
swiftly still!&rdquo; it made them speed onwards, madly,
blindly, with the headlong rush of a storm. There was
no hope for them to keep on the beaten track, and soon
Phaeton had his rapture checked by the terrible realisation
that they had strayed far out of the course and that
his hands were not strong enough to guide them. Close
to the Great Bear and the Little Bear they passed, and
these were scorched with heat. The Serpent which, torpid,
chilly and harmless, lies coiled round the North Pole, felt
a warmth that made it grow fierce and harmful again.
Downward, ever downward galloped the maddened horses,
and soon Phaeton saw the sea as a shield of molten brass,
and the earth so near that all things on it were visible.
When they passed the Scorpion and only just missed
destruction from its menacing fangs, fear entered into the
boy&rsquo;s heart. His mother had spoken truth. He was
only partly a god, and he was very, very young. In
impotent horror he tugged at the reins to try to check the
horses&rsquo; descent, then, forgetful of Apollo&rsquo;s warning, he
smote them angrily. But anger met anger, and the fury
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg&nbsp;23]</a></span>
of the immortal steeds had scorn for the wrath of a mortal
boy. With a great toss of their mighty heads they had
torn the guiding reins from his grasp, and as he stood,
giddily swaying from side to side, Phaeton knew that the
boon he had craved from his father must in truth be
death for him.</p>

<p>And, lo, it was a hideous death, for with eyes that
were like flames that burned his brain, the boy beheld
the terrible havoc that his pride had wrought. That
blazing chariot of the Sun made the clouds smoke, and
dried up all the rivers and water-springs. Fire burst
from the mountain tops, great cities were destroyed.
The beauty of the earth was ravished, woods and
meadows and all green and pleasant places were laid
waste. The harvests perished, the flocks and they who
had herded them lay dead. Over Libya the horses took
him, and the desert of Libya remains a barren wilderness
to this day, while those sturdy Ethiopians who survived
are black even now as a consequence of that cruel heat.
The Nile changed its course in order to escape, and nymphs
and nereids in terror sought for the sanctuary of some
watery place that had escaped destruction. The face of
the burned and blackened earth, where the bodies of
thousands of human beings lay charred to ashes, cracked
and sent dismay to Pluto by the lurid light that penetrated
even to his throne.</p>

<p>All this Phaeton saw, saw in impotent agony of soul.
His boyish folly and pride had been great, but the excruciating
anguish that made him shed tears of blood,
was indeed a punishment even too heavy for an erring god.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg&nbsp;24]</a></span>
From the havoc around her, the Earth at last looked
up, and with blackened face and blinded eyes, and in a
voice that was harsh and very, very weary, she called
to Zeus to look down from Olympus and behold the ruin
that had been wrought by the chariot of the Sun. And
Zeus, the cloud-gatherer, looked down and beheld. And
at the sight of that piteous devastation his brow grew
dark, and terrible was his wrath against him who had
held the reins of the chariot. Calling upon Apollo and
all the other gods to witness him, he seized a lightning
bolt, and for a moment the deathless Zeus and all the
dwellers in Olympus looked on the fiery chariot in which
stood the swaying, slight, lithe figure of a young lad,
blinded with horror, shaken with agony. Then, from
his hand, Zeus cast the bolt, and the chariot was dashed
into fragments, and Phaeton, his golden hair ablaze, fell,
like a bright shooting star, from the heavens above,
into the river Eridanus. The steeds returned to their
master, Apollo, and in rage and grief Apollo lashed them.
Angrily, too, and very rebelliously did he speak of the
punishment meted to his son by the ruler of the Immortals.
Yet in truth the punishment was a merciful one.
Phaeton was only half a god, and no human life were fit
to live after the day of dire anguish that had been his.</p>

<p>Bitter was the mourning of Clymene over her beautiful
only son, and so ceaselessly did his three sisters, the
Heliades, weep for their brother, that the gods turned
them into poplar trees that grew by the bank of the river,
and, when still they wept, their tears turned into precious
amber as they fell. Yet another mourned for Phaeton&mdash;Phaeton
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg&nbsp;25]</a></span>
&ldquo;dead ere his prime.&rdquo; Cycnus, King of Liguria,
had dearly loved the gallant boy, and again and yet again
he dived deep in the river and brought forth the charred
fragments of what had once been the beautiful son of a
god, and gave to them honourable burial. Yet he could
not rest satisfied that he had won all that remained of his
friend from the river&rsquo;s bed, and so he continued to haunt
the stream, ever diving, ever searching, until the gods
grew weary of his restless sorrow and changed him into a
swan.</p>

<p>And still we see the swan sailing mournfully along,
like a white-sailed barque that is bearing the body of a
king to its rest, and ever and anon plunging deep into
the water as though the search for the boy who would
fain have been a god were never to come to an end.</p>

<p>To Phaeton the Italian Naiades reared a tomb, and
inscribed on the stone these words:</p>

<h2>ENDYMION</h2>


<p>To the modern popular mind perhaps none of the goddesses
of Greece&mdash;not even Venus herself&mdash;has more
appeal than has the huntress goddess, Diana. Those
who know but little of ancient statuary can still brighten
to intelligent recognition of the huntress with her quiver
and her little stag when they meet with them in picture
gallery or in suburban garden. That unlettered sportsman
in weather-worn pink, slowly riding over the fragrant
dead leaves by the muddy roadside on this chill, grey
morning, may never have heard of Artemis, but he is
quite ready to make intelligent reference to Diana to the
handsome young sportswoman whom he finds by the
covert side; and Sir Walter&rsquo;s Diana Vernon has helped
the little-read public to realise that the original Diana was
a goddess worthy of being sponsor to one of the finest
heroines of fiction.</p>

<p>But not to the sportsman alone, but also to the youth
or maid who loves the moon&mdash;they know not why&mdash;to
those whom the shadows of the trees on a woodland path
at night mean a grip of the heart, while &ldquo;pale Dian&rdquo;
scuds over the dark clouds that are soaring far beyond
the tree-tops and is peeping, chaste and pale, through the
branches of the firs and giant pines, there is something
arresting, enthralling, in the thought of the goddess
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg&nbsp;27]</a></span>
Diana who now has for hunting-ground the blue firmament
of heaven where the pale Pleiades</p>

<p>Again and again in mythological history we come on
stories of the goddess, sometimes under her best known
name of Diana, sometimes under her older Greek name
of Artemis, and now and again as Selene, the moon-goddess,
the Luna of the Romans. Her twin brother was
Apollo, god of the sun, and with him she shared the
power of unerringly wielding a bow and of sending grave
plagues and pestilences, while both were patrons of music
and of poetry.</p>

<p>When the sun-god&rsquo;s golden chariot had driven down
into the west, then would his sister&rsquo;s noiseless-footed silver
steeds be driven across the sky, while the huntress shot
from her bow at will silent arrows that would slay without
warning a joyous young mother with her newly-born babe,
or would wantonly pierce, with a lifelong pain, the heart
of some luckless mortal.</p>

<p>Now one night as she passed Mount Latmos, there
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg&nbsp;28]</a></span>
chanced to be a shepherd lad lying asleep beside his
sleeping flock. Many times had Endymion watched the
goddess from afar, half afraid of one so beautiful and
yet so ruthless, but never before had Diana realised the
youth&rsquo;s wonderful beauty. She checked her hounds when
they would have swept on in their chase through the
night, and stood beside Endymion. She judged him to
be as perfect as her own brother, Apollo&mdash;yet more
perfect, perhaps, for on his upturned sleeping face
was the silver glamour of her own dear moon. Fierce
and burning passion could come with the sun&rsquo;s burning
rays, but love that came in the moon&rsquo;s pale light was
passion mixed with gramarye. She gazed for long, and
when, in his sleep, Endymion smiled, she knelt beside
him and, stooping, gently kissed his lips. The touch of a
moonbeam on a sleeping rose was no more gentle than was
Diana&rsquo;s touch, yet it was sufficient to wake Endymion.
And as, while one&rsquo;s body sleeps on, one&rsquo;s half-waking mind,
now and again in a lifetime seems to realise an ecstasy
of happiness so perfect that one dares not wake lest, by
waking, the wings of one&rsquo;s realised ideal should slip
between grasping fingers and so escape forever, so did
Endymion realise the kiss of the goddess. But before
his sleepy eyes could be his senses&rsquo; witnesses, Diana had
hastened away. Endymion, springing to his feet, saw
only his sleeping flock, nor did his dogs awake when he
heard what seemed to him to be the baying of hounds in
full cry in a forest far up the mountain. Only to his own
heart did he dare to whisper what was this wonderful
thing that he believed had befallen him, and although he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg&nbsp;29]</a></span>
laid himself down, hoping that once again this miracle
might be granted to him, no miracle came; nor could
he sleep, so great was his longing.</p>

<span class="caption">SHE CHECKED HER HOUNDS, AND STOOD BESIDE ENDYMION</span>
</div>

<p>All the next day, through the sultry hours while Apollo
drove his chariot of burnished gold through the land,
Endymion, as he watched his flocks, tried to dream his
dream once more, and longed for the day to end and the
cool, dark night to return. When night came he tried to
lie awake and see what might befall, but when kind sleep
had closed his tired eyes,</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Lewis Morris.</span></p>

<p>Always she kissed him, yet when her kiss awoke him
he never could see anything more tangible than a shaft
of silver moonlight on the moving bushes of the mountain
side, never hear anything more real than the far-away
echo of the baying of pursuing hounds, and if, with eager,
greatly-daring eyes, he looked skywards, a dark cloud,
so it seemed to him, would always hasten to hide the moon
from his longing gaze.</p>

<p>In this manner time passed on. The days of Endymion
were filled by longing day-dreams. His sleeping
hours ever brought him ecstasy. Ever, too, to the goddess,
the human being that she loved seemed to her to
grow more precious. For her all the joy of day and of
night was concentrated in the moments she spent by the
side of the sleeping Endymion. The flocks of the shepherd
flourished like those of no other herd. No wild
beast dared come near them; no storm nor disease
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg&nbsp;30]</a></span>
assailed them. Yet for Endymion the things of earth no
longer held any value. He lived only for his dear dream&rsquo;s
sake. Had he been permitted to grow old and worn and
tired, and still a dreamer, who knows how his story might
have ended? But to Diana there came the fear that with
age his beauty might wane, and from her father, Zeus,
she obtained for the one she loved the gifts of unending
youth and of eternal sleep.</p>

<p>There came a night when the dreams of Endymion
had no end. That was a night when the moon made
for herself broad silver paths across the sea, from far
horizon to the shore where the little waves lapped and
curled in a radiant, ever-moving silver fringe. Silver
also were the leaves of the forest trees, and between the
branches of the solemn cypresses and of the stately
dark pines, Diana shot her silver arrows. No baying
of hounds came then to make Endymion&rsquo;s flocks move
uneasily in their sleep, but the silver stars seemed
to sing in unison together. While still those gentle
lips touched his, hands as gentle lifted up the sleeping
Endymion and bore him to a secret cave in Mount Latmos.
And there, for evermore, she came to kiss the
mouth of her sleeping lover. There, forever, slept Endymion,
happy in the perfect bliss of dreams that have no
ugly awaking, of an ideal love that knows no ending.</p>

<p>It is the custom nowadays for scientists and for other
scholarly people to take hold of the old myths, to take
them to pieces, and to find some deep, hidden meaning in
each part of the story. So you will find that some will
tell you that Orpheus is the personification of the winds
which &ldquo;tear up trees as they course along, chanting their
wild music,&rdquo; and that Eurydice is the morning &ldquo;with its
short-lived beauty.&rdquo; Others say that Orpheus is &ldquo;the
mythological expression of the delight which music gives
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg&nbsp;32]</a></span>
to the primitive races,&rdquo; while yet others accept without
hesitation the idea that Orpheus is the sun that, when day
is done, plunges into the black abyss of night, in the vain
hope of overtaking his lost bride, Eurydice, the rosy dawn.
And, whether they be right or wrong, it would seem that
the sadness that comes to us sometimes as the day dies
and the last of the sun&rsquo;s rays vanish to leave the hills and
valleys dark and cold, the sorrowful feeling that we cannot
understand when, in country places, we hear music coming
from far away, or listen to the plaintive song of the bird,
are things that very specially belong to the story of
Orpheus.</p>

<p>In the country of Thrace, surrounded by all the best
gifts of the gods, Orpheus was born. His father was
Apollo, the god of music and of song, his mother the
muse Calliope. Apollo gave his little son a lyre, and himself
taught him how to play it. It was not long before
all the wild things in the woods of Thrace crept out from
the green trees and thick undergrowth, and from the holes
and caves in the rocks, to listen to the music that the
child&rsquo;s fingers made. The coo of the dove to his mate,
the flute-clear trill of the blackbird, the song of the lark,
the liquid carol of the nightingale&mdash;all ceased when the
boy made music. The winds that whispered their secrets
to the trees owned him for their lord, and the proudest
trees of the forest bowed their heads that they might not
miss one exquisite sigh that his fingers drew from the
magical strings. Nor man nor beast lived in his day that
he could not sway by the power of his melody. He played
a lullaby, and all things slept. He played a love-lilt, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg&nbsp;33]</a></span>
the flowers sprang up in full bloom from the cold earth,
and the dreaming red rosebud opened wide her velvet
petals, and all the land seemed full of the loving echoes of
the lilt he played. He played a war-march, and, afar off,
the sleeping tyrants of the forest sprang up, wide awake,
and bared their angry teeth, and the untried youths of
Thrace ran to beg their fathers to let them taste battle,
while the scarred warriors felt on their thumbs the sharpness
of their sword blades, and smiled, well content.
While he played it would seem as though the very stones
and rocks gained hearts. Nay, the whole heart of the
universe became one great, palpitating, beautiful thing,
an instrument from whose trembling strings was drawn
out the music of Orpheus.</p>

<p>He rose to great power, and became a mighty prince
of Thrace. Not his lute alone, but he himself played on
the heart of the fair Eurydice and held it captive. It
seemed as though, when they became man and wife, all
happiness must be theirs. But although Hymen, the god of
marriage, himself came to bless them on the day they wed,
the omens on that day were against them. The torch that
Hymen carried had no golden flame, but sent out pungent
black smoke that made their eyes water. They feared
they knew not what; but when, soon afterwards, as Eurydice
wandered with the nymphs, her companions, through
the blue-shadowed woods of Thrace, the reason was discovered.
A bold shepherd, who did not know her for a
princess, saw Eurydice, and no sooner saw her than he
loved her. He ran after her to proclaim to her his love,
and she, afraid of his wild uncouthness, fled before him. She
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg&nbsp;34]</a></span>
ran, in her terror, too swiftly to watch whither she went,
and a poisonous snake that lurked amongst the fern bit the
fair white foot that flitted, like a butterfly, across it. In
agonised suffering Eurydice died. Her spirit went to the
land of the Shades, and Orpheus was left broken-hearted.</p>

<p>The sad winds that blow at night across the sea, the
sobbing gales that tell of wreck and death, the birds that
wail in the darkness for their mates, the sad, soft whisper
of the aspen leaves and the leaves of the heavy clad blue-black
cypresses, all now were hushed, for greater than all,
more full of bitter sorrow than any, arose the music of
Orpheus, a long-drawn sob from a broken heart in the
Valley of the Shadow of Death.</p>

<p>Grief came alike to gods and to men as they listened,
but no comfort came to him from the expression of his
sorrow. At length, when to bear his grief longer was
impossible for him, Orpheus wandered to Olympus, and
there besought Zeus to give him permission to seek his
wife in the gloomy land of the Shades. Zeus, moved
by his anguish, granted the permission he sought, but
solemnly warned him of the terrible perils of his undertaking.</p>

<p>But the love of Orpheus was too perfect to know any
fear; thankfully he hastened to the dark cave on the
side of the promontory of Taenarus, and soon arrived at
the entrance of Hades. Stark and grim was the three-headed
watchdog, Cerberus, which guarded the door, and
with the growls and the furious roaring of a wild beast
athirst for its prey it greeted Orpheus. But Orpheus
touched his lute, and the brute, amazed, sank into silence.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg&nbsp;35]</a></span>
And still he played, and the dog would gently have licked
the player&rsquo;s feet, and looked up in his face with its savage
eyes full of the light that we see in the eyes of the dogs of
this earth as they gaze with love at their masters. On,
then, strode Orpheus, playing still, and the melody he drew
from his lute passed before him into the realms of Pluto.</p>

<p>Surely never were heard such strains. They told of
perfect, tender love, of unending longing, of pain too
great to end with death. Of all the beauties of the earth
they sang&mdash;of the sorrow of the world&mdash;of all the world&rsquo;s
desire&mdash;of things past&mdash;of things to come. And ever,
through the song that the lute sang, there came, like a
thread of silver that is woven in a black velvet pall, a
limpid melody. It was as though a bird sang in the mirk
night, and it spoke of peace and of hope, and of joy that
knows no ending.</p>

<p>Into the blackest depths of Hades the sounds sped on
their way, and the hands of Time stood still. From his
bitter task of trying to quaff the stream that ever receded
from the parched and burning lips, Tantalus ceased for a
moment. The ceaseless course of Ixion&rsquo;s wheel was stayed,
the vulture&rsquo;s relentless beak no longer tore at the Titan&rsquo;s
liver; Sisyphus gave up his weary task of rolling the stone
and sat on the rock to listen, the Dana&iuml;des rested from their
labour of drawing water in a sieve. For the first time, the
cheeks of the Furies were wet with tears, and the restless
shades that came and went in the darkness, like dead
autumn leaves driven by a winter gale, stood still to gaze
and listen. Before the throne where Pluto and his queen
Proserpine were seated, sable-clad and stern, the relentless
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg&nbsp;36]</a></span>
Fates at their feet, Orpheus still played on. And to
Proserpine then came the living remembrance of all the
joys of her girlhood by the blue &AElig;gean Sea in the fair
island of Sicily. Again she knew the fragrance and the
beauty of the flowers of spring. Even into Hades the scent
of the violets seemed to come, and fresh in her heart was
the sorrow that had been hers on the day on which the
ruthless King of Darkness tore her from her mother and
from all that she held most dear. Silent she sat beside
her frowning, stern-faced lord, but her eyes grew dim.</p>

<p>When, with a quivering sigh, the music stopped,
Orpheus fearlessly pled his cause. To let him have Eurydice,
to give him back his more than life, to grant that he
might lead her with him up to &ldquo;the light of Heaven&rdquo;&mdash;that
was his prayer.</p>

<p>The eyes of Pluto and Proserpine did not dare to meet,
yet with one accord was their answer given. Eurydice
should be given back to him, but only on one condition.
Not until he had reached the light of earth again was he
to turn round and look upon the face for a sight of which
his eyes were tired with longing. Eagerly Orpheus complied,
and with a heart almost breaking with gladness he
heard the call for Eurydice and turned to retrace his way,
with the light footfall of the little feet that he adored
making music behind him. Too good a thing it seemed&mdash;too
unbelievable a joy. She was there&mdash;quite close to
him. Their days of happiness were not ended. His love
had won her back, even from the land of darkness. All
that he had not told her of that love while yet she was on
earth he would tell her now. All that he had failed in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg&nbsp;37]</a></span>
before, he would make perfect now. The little limping
foot&mdash;how it made his soul overflow with adoring tenderness.
So near she was, he might even touch her were he
to stretch back his hand....</p>

<p>And then there came to him a hideous doubt. What
if Pluto had played him false? What if there followed
him not Eurydice, but a mocking shade? As he climbed
the steep ascent that led upwards to the light, his fear grew
more cruelly real. Almost he could imagine that her
footsteps had stopped, that when he reached the light he
would find himself left once more to his cruel loneliness.
Too overwhelming for him was the doubt. So nearly there
they were that the darkness was no longer that of night,
but as that of evening when the long shadows fall upon
the land, and there seemed no reason for Orpheus to wait.</p>

<p>Swiftly he turned, and found his wife behind him, but
only for a moment she stayed. Her arms were thrown
open and Orpheus would fain have grasped her in his
own, but before they could touch each other Eurydice
was borne from him, back into the darkness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Farewell!&rdquo; she said&mdash;&ldquo;Farewell!&rdquo; and her voice
was a sigh of hopeless grief. In mad desperation Orpheus
sought to follow her, but his attempt was vain. At the
brink of the dark, fierce-flooded Acheron the boat with its
boatman, old Charon, lay ready to ferry across to the
further shore those whose future lay in the land of Shades.
To him ran Orpheus, in clamorous anxiety to undo the
evil he had wrought. But Charon angrily repulsed
him. There was no place for such as Orpheus in his
ferry-boat. Those only who went, never to return, could
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg&nbsp;38]</a></span>
find a passage there. For seven long days and seven
longer nights Orpheus waited beside the river, hoping
that Charon would relent, but at last hope died, and he
sought the depths of the forests of Thrace, where trees
and rocks and beasts and birds were all his friends.</p>

<p>He took his lyre again then and played:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Such strains as would have won the ear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Pluto, to have quite set free<br /></span>

</div>
</div>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Milton.</span></p>

<p>Day and night he stayed in the shadow of the woodlands,
all the sorrow of his heart expressing itself in
the song of his lute. The fiercest beasts of the forest
crawled to his feet and looked up at him with eyes full
of pity. The song of the birds ceased, and when the
wind moaned through the trees they echoed his cry,
&ldquo;Eurydice! Eurydice!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the dawning hours it would seem to him that he
saw her again, flitting, a thing of mist and rising sun,
across the dimness of the woods. And when evening
came and all things rested, and the night called out
the mystery of the forest, again he would see her.
In the long blue shadows of the trees she would stand&mdash;up
the woodland paths she walked, where her little
feet fluttered the dry leaves as she passed. Her face
was white as a lily in the moonlight, and ever she held
out her arms to Orpheus:</p>

For Orpheus it was a good day when Jason, chief of
the Argonauts, sought him out to bid him come with the
other heroes and aid in the quest of the Golden Fleece.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have I not had enough of toil and of weary wandering
far and wide,&rdquo; sighed Orpheus. &ldquo;In vain is the
skill of the voice which my goddess mother gave me;
in vain have I sung and laboured; in vain I went down
to the dead, and charmed all the kings of Hades, to win
back Eurydice, my bride. For I won her, my beloved,
and lost her again the same day, and wandered away
in my madness even to Egypt and the Libyan sands,
and the isles of all the seas.... While I charmed in
vain the hearts of men, and the savage forest beasts,
and the trees, and the lifeless stones, with my magic
harp and song, giving rest, but finding none.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>But in the good ship <i>Argo</i>, Orpheus took his place
with the others and sailed the watery ways, and the
songs that Orpheus sang to his shipmates and that tell
of all their great adventures are called the Songs of
Orpheus, or the Orphics, to this day.</p>

<p>Many were the mishaps and disasters that his music
warded off. With it he lulled monsters to sleep; more
powerful to work magic on the hearts of men were his
melodies than were the songs of the sirens when they tried
to capture the Argonauts by their wiles, and in their
downward, destroying rush his music checked mountains.</p>

<p>When the quest of the Argonauts was ended, Orpheus
returned to his own land of Thrace. As a hero he had
fought and endured hardship, but his wounded soul
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg&nbsp;40]</a></span>
remained unhealed. Again the trees listened to the
songs of longing. Again they echoed, &ldquo;Eurydice!
Eurydice!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he sat one day near a river in the stillness of the
forest, there came from afar an ugly clamour of sound.
It struck against the music of Orpheus&rsquo; lute and slew
it, as the coarse cries of the screaming gulls that fight
for carrion slay the song of a soaring lark. It was the
day of the feast of Bacchus, and through the woods
poured Bacchus and his Bacchantes, a shameless rout,
satyrs capering around them, centaurs neighing aloud.
Long had the Bacchantes hated the loyal poet-lover of
one fair woman whose dwelling was with the Shades.
His ears were ever deaf to their passionate voices, his
eyes blind to their passionate loveliness as they danced
through the green trees, a riot of colour, of fierce beauty,
of laughter and of mad song. Mad they were indeed
this day, and in their madness the very existence of
Orpheus was a thing not to be borne. At first they
stoned him, but his music made the stones fall harmless
at his feet. Then in a frenzy of cruelty, with the
maniac lust to cause blood to flow, to know the joy of
taking life, they threw themselves upon Orpheus and
did him to death. From limb to limb they tore him,
casting at last his head and his blood-stained lyre into
the river. And still, as the water bore them on, the
lyre murmured its last music and the white lips of
Orpheus still breathed of her whom at last he had gone
to join in the shadowy land, &ldquo;Eurydice! Eurydice!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Combien d&rsquo;autres sont morts de m&ecirc;me! C&rsquo;est la
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg&nbsp;41]</a></span>
lutte &eacute;ternelle de la force brutale contre l&rsquo;intelligence
douce et sublime inspir&eacute;e du ciel, dont le royaume n&rsquo;est
pas de ce monde.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the heavens, as a bright constellation called
Lyra, or Orpheus, the gods placed his lute, and to the
place of his martyrdom came the Muses, and with loving
care carried the fragments of the massacred body to
Libetlera, at the foot of Mount Olympus, and there buried
them. And there, unto this day, more sweetly than at
any other spot in any other land, the nightingale sings.
For it sings of a love that knows no ending, of life
after death, of a love so strong that it can conquer even
Death, the all-powerful.</p>

<h2>APOLLO AND DAPHNE</h2>


<p>Conqueror of all conquerable earth, yet not always victorious
over the heart of a maid was the golden-locked
Apollo.</p>

<p>As mischievous Eros played one day with his bow
and arrows, Apollo beheld him and spoke to him mockingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What hast thou to do with the weapons of war,
saucy lad?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Leave them for hands such as
mine, that know full well how to wield them. Content
thyself with thy torch, and kindle flames, if indeed thou
canst, but such bolts as thy white young arms can
drive will surely not bring scathe to god nor to man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then did the son of Aphrodite answer, and as he
made answer he laughed aloud in his glee. &ldquo;With
thine arrows thou mayst strike all things else, great
Apollo, a shaft of mine shall surely strike thy heart!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Carefully, then, did Eros choose two arrows from his
quiver. One, sharp-pointed and of gold, he fitted carefully
to his bow, drew back the string until it was taut,
and then let fly the arrow, that did not miss its mark,
but flew straight to the heart of the sun-god. With
the other arrow, blunt, and tipped with lead, he smote
the beautiful Daphne, daughter of Peneus, the river-god.
And then, full joyously did the boy-god laugh, for his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg&nbsp;43]</a></span>
roguish heart knew well that to him who was struck by
the golden shaft must come the last pangs that have
proved many a man&rsquo;s and many a god&rsquo;s undoing, while
that leaden-tipped arrow meant to whomsoever it struck,
a hatred of Love and an immunity from all the heart
weakness that Love can bring. Those were the days
when Apollo was young. Never before had he loved.</p>

<p>But as the first fierce storm that assails it bends the
young, supple tree with its green budding leaves before
its furious blast, so did the first love of Apollo bend low
his adoring heart. All day as he held the golden reins
of his chariot, until evening when its fiery wheels were
cooled in the waters of the western seas, he thought of
Daphne. All night he dreamed of her. But never did
there come to Daphne a time when she loved Love for
Love&rsquo;s sake. Never did she look with gentle eye on
the golden-haired god whose face was as the face of all
the exquisite things that the sunlight shows, remembered
in a dream. Her only passion was a passion for
the chase. One of Diana&rsquo;s nymphs was she, cold and
pure and white in soul as the virgin goddess herself.</p>

<p>There came a day when Apollo could no longer put
curbing hands on his fierce longing. The flames from
his chariot still lingered in reflected glories on sea and
hill and sky. The very leaves of the budding trees of
spring were outlined in gold. And through the dim
wood walked Daphne, erect and lithe and living as a
sapling in the early spring.</p>

<p>With beseeching hands, Apollo followed her. A
god was he, yet to him had come the vast humility of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg&nbsp;44]</a></span>
passionate intercession for the gift of love to a little
nymph. She heard his steps behind her and turned
round, proud and angry that one should follow her
when she had not willed it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stay!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;daughter of Peneus. No foe am
I, but thine own humble lover. To thee alone do I bow
my head. To all others on earth am I conqueror and
king.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Daphne, hating his words of passionate love, sped
on. And when his passion lent wings to his feet and she
heard him gaining on her as she fled, not as a lover did
Daphne look on deathless Apollo, but as a hateful foe.
More swiftly than she had ever run beside her mistress
Diana, leaving the flying winds behind her as she sped,
ran Daphne now. But ever did Apollo gain upon her,
and almost had he grasped her when she reached the
green banks of the river of which her father, Peneus, was
god.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Help me, Peneus!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Save me, oh my
father, from him whose love I fear!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As she spoke the arms of Apollo seized her, yet,
even as his arms met around her waist, lissome and
slight as a young willow, Daphne the nymph was Daphne
the nymph no longer. Her fragrant hair, her soft white
arms, her tender body all changed as the sun-god
touched them. Her feet took root in the soft, damp
earth by the river. Her arms sprouted into woody
branches and green leaves. Her face vanished, and the
bark of a big tree enclosed her snow-white body. Yet
Apollo did not take away his embrace from her who had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg&nbsp;45]</a></span>
been his dear first love. He knew that her cry to Peneus
her father had been answered, yet he said, &ldquo;Since thou
canst not be my bride, at least thou shalt be my tree;
my hair, my lyre, my quiver shall have thee always, oh
laurel tree of the Immortals!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So do we still speak of laurels won, and worn by those
of deathless fame, and still does the first love of Apollo
crown the heads of those whose gifts have fitted them
to dwell with the dwellers on Olympus.</p>

<h2>PSYCHE</h2>


<p>Those who read for the first time the story of Psyche
must at once be struck by its kinship to the fairy
tales of childhood. Here we have the three sisters, the
two elder jealous and spiteful, the youngest beautiful
and gentle and quite unable to defend herself against
her sisters&rsquo; wicked arts. Here, too, is the mysterious
bridegroom who is never seen and who is lost to his
bride because of her lack of faith. Truly it is an old,
old tale&mdash;older than all fairy tales&mdash;the story of love
that is not strong enough to believe and to wait, and so
to &ldquo;win through&rdquo; in the end&mdash;the story of seeds of suspicion
sown by one full of malice in an innocent heart,
and which bring to the hapless reaper a cruel harvest.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, so goes the tale, a king and queen
had three beautiful daughters. The first and the second
were fair indeed, but the beauty of the youngest was
such that all the people of the land worshipped it as a
thing sent straight from Olympus. They awaited her
outside the royal palace, and when she came, they
threw chaplets of roses and violets for her little feet to
tread upon, and sang hymns of praise as though she were
no mortal maiden but a daughter of the deathless gods.</p>

<p>There were many who said that the beauty of
Aphrodite herself was less perfect than the beauty of
Psyche, and when the goddess found that men were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg&nbsp;47]</a></span>
forsaking her altars in order to worship a mortal maiden,
great was her wrath against them and against the princess
who, all unwittingly, had wrought her this shameful
harm.</p>

<p>In her garden, sitting amongst the flowers and idly
watching his mother&rsquo;s fair white doves as they preened
their snowy feathers in the sun, Aphrodite found her
son Eros, and angrily poured forth to him the story
of her shame.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thine must be the task of avenging thy mother&rsquo;s
honour,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Thou who hast the power of
making the loves of men, stab with one of thine arrows
the heart of this presumptuous maiden, and shame her
before all other mortals by making her love a monster
from which all others shrink and which all despise.&rdquo;
With wicked glee Eros heard his mother&rsquo;s commands.
His beautiful face, still the face of a mischievous boy,
lit up with merriment. This was, in truth, a game after
his own heart. In the garden of Aphrodite is a fountain
of sweet, another of bitter water, and Eros filled two
amber vases, one from each fountain, hung them from
his quiver, and</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Straight he rose from earth and down the wind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Went glittering &rsquo;twixt the blue sky and the sea.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>In her chamber Psyche lay fast asleep, and swiftly,
almost without a glance at her, Eros sprinkled some of
the bitter drops upon her lips, and then, with one of
his sharpest arrows, pricked her snowy breast. Like a
child who half awakes in fear, and looks up with puzzled,
wondering eyes, Psyche, with a little moan, opened
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg&nbsp;48]</a></span>
eyes that were bluer than the violets in spring and gazed
at Eros. He knew that he was invisible, and yet her
gaze made him tremble.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They spoke truth!&rdquo; said the lad to himself. &ldquo;Not
even my mother is as fair as this princess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment her eyelids quivered, and then dropped.
Her long dark lashes fell on her cheeks that were pink as
the hearts of the fragile shells that the waves toss up on
western beaches, her red mouth, curved like the bow of
Eros, smiled happily, and Psyche slept again. With
heart that beat as it had never beaten before, Eros
gazed upon her perfect loveliness. With gentle, pitying
finger he wiped away the red drop where his arrow had
wounded her, and then stooped and touched her lips with
his own, so lightly that Psyche in her dreams thought
that they had been brushed by a butterfly&rsquo;s wings. Yet
in her sleep she moved, and Eros, starting back, pricked
himself with one of his arrows. And with that prick,
for Eros there passed away all the careless ease of the
heart of a boy, and he knew that he loved Psyche with
the unquenchable love of a deathless god. Now, with
bitter regret, all his desire was to undo the wrong he
had done to the one that he loved. Speedily he sprinkled
her with the sweet water that brings joy, and when
Psyche rose from her couch she was radiant with the
beauty that comes from a new, undreamed-of happiness.</p>

<p>Meantime it came to be known all over that land,
and in other lands to which the fame of the fair Psyche
had spread, that the mighty goddess Aphrodite had
declared herself the enemy of the princess. Therefore
none dared seek her in marriage, and although many a
noble youth sighed away his heart for love of her, she
remained in her father&rsquo;s palace like an exquisite rose
whose thorns make those who fain would have it
for their own, fear to pluck it from the parent stem.
Her sisters married, and her father marvelled why so
strange a thing should come about and why the most
beautiful by far of his three daughters should remain
unwed.</p>

<p>At length, laden with royal gifts, an embassy was
sent by the king to the oracle of Apollo to inquire what
might be the will of the dwellers on Olympus concerning
his fairest daughter. In a horror of anxiety the king
and his queen and Psyche awaited the return of the
ambassadors. And when they returned, before ever a
word was spoken, they knew that the oracle had spoken
Psyche&rsquo;s doom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No mortal lover shall fair Psyche know,&rdquo; said the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg&nbsp;50]</a></span>
oracle. &ldquo;For bridegroom she shall have a monster
that neither man nor god can resist. On the mountain
top he awaits her coming. Woe unutterable shall come
to the king and to all the dwellers in his land if he dares
to resist the unalterable dictum of the deathless gods!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;... Of dead corpses shalt thou be the king,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stumbling through the dark land shalt thou go,<br /></span>

</div>

<p>Only for a little while did the wretched king strive
to resist the decrees of fate. And in her own chamber,
where so short a time before the little princess had
known the joy of something inexpressible&mdash;something
most exquisite&mdash;intangible&mdash;unknown&mdash;she sat, like a
flower broken by the ruthless storm, sobbing pitifully,
dry-eyed, with sobs that strained her soul, for the
shameful, hideous fate that the gods had dealt her.</p>

<p>All night, until her worn-out body could no longer
feel, her worn-out mind think, and kind sleep came to
bring her oblivion, Psyche faced the horror for the sake
of her father and of his people, that she knew she could
not avoid. When morning came, her handmaids, white-faced
and red-eyed, came to deck her in all the bridal
magnificence that befitted the most beautiful daughter
of a king, and when she was dressed right royally, and
as became a bride, there started up the mountain a
procession at sight of which the gods themselves must
have wept. With bowed heads the king and queen
walked before the litter upon which lay their daughter
in her marriage veil of saffron colour, with rose wreath
on her golden hair. White, white were the faces of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg&nbsp;51]</a></span>
maidens who bore the torches, and yet rose red were
they by the side of Psyche. Minstrels played wedding
hymns as they marched onwards, and it seemed as though
the souls of unhappy shades sobbed through the reeds
and moaned through the strings as they played.</p>

<p>At length they reached the rocky place where they
knew they must leave the victim bride, and her father
dared not meet her eyes as he turned his head to go.
Yet Psyche watched the procession wending its way
downhill. No more tears had she to shed, and it seemed
to her that what she saw was not a wedding throng, but
an assembly of broken-hearted people who went back
to their homes with heavy feet after burying one that
they loved. She saw no sign of the monster who was to
be her bridegroom, yet at every little sound her heart
grew sick with horror, and when the night wind swept
through the craggy peaks and its moans were echoed in
loneliness, she fell on her face in deadly fear and lay on
the cold rock in a swoon.</p>

<p>Yet, had Psyche known it, the wind was her friend.
For Eros had used Zephyrus as his trusty messenger
and sent him to the mountain top to find the bride of
him &ldquo;whom neither man nor god could resist.&rdquo; Tenderly&mdash;very
tenderly&mdash;he was told, must he lift her in his
arms, and bear her to the golden palace in that green
and pleasant land where Eros had his home. So, with
all the gentleness of a loving nurse to a tired little child
Zephyrus lifted Psyche, and sped with her in his strong
arms to the flowery meadows behind which towered the
golden palace of Eros, like the sun behind a sky of green
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg&nbsp;52]</a></span>
and amber and blue and rose. Deeply, in the weariness
of her grief, Psyche slept, and when she awoke it was
to start up with the chill hands of the realisation of
terrible actualities on her heart. But when her eyes
looked round to find the barren rocks, the utter forsakenness,
the coming of an unnameable horror, before her
she saw only fair groves with trees bedecked with fruit
and blossom, fragrant meadows, flowers whose beauty
made her eyes grow glad. And from the trees sang
birds with song more sweet than any that Psyche had
ever known, and with brilliant plumage which they
preened caressingly when they had dipped their wings
in crystal-sparkling fountains. There, too, stood a
noble palace, golden fronted, and with arcades of stainless
marble that shone like snow in the sun. At first
all seemed like part of a dream from which she dreaded
to awake, but soon there came to her the joy of knowing
that all the exquisite things that made appeal to her
senses were indeed realities. Almost holding her breath,
she walked forward to the open golden doors. &ldquo;It is a
trap,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;By this means does the monster
subtly mean to lure me into his golden cage.&rdquo; Yet,
even as she thought, there seemed to be hovering round
her winged words, like little golden birds with souls.
And in her ears they whispered, &ldquo;Fear not. Doubt not.
Recall the half-formed dreams that so short a time ago
brought to thy heart such unutterable joy. No evil
shall come to thee&mdash;only the bliss of loving and of being
loved.&rdquo;</p>

<span class="caption">THUS DID PSYCHE LOSE HER FEAR, AND ENTER THE GOLDEN DOORS</span>
</div>

<p>Thus did Psyche lose her fear, and enter the golden
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg&nbsp;53]</a></span>
doors. And inside the palace she found that all the
beautiful things of which she had ever dreamed, all the
perfect things for which she had ever longed, were there
to greet her. From one to another she flitted, like a
humming-bird that sucks honey from one and then
from another gorgeous flower. And then, when she was
tired with so much wearing out of her thankful mind,
she found a banquet ready spread for her, with all the
dainties that her dainty soul liked best; and, as
she ate, music so perfect rejoiced her ears that all her
soul was soothed and joyous and at peace. When she
had refreshed herself, a soft couch stood before
her, ready for her there to repose, and when that
strange day had come to an end, Psyche knew that,
monster or not, she was beloved by one who had
thought for her every thought, and who desired only
her desire.</p>

<p>Night came at last, and when all was dark and still,
and Psyche, wide awake, was full of forebodings and fears
lest her happy dreams might only be misleading fancies,
and Horror incarnate might come to crown her peaceful
day, Eros softly entered the palace that was his own.
Even as he had gone to the palace of her father he went
now, and found Psyche lying with violet eyes that
stared into the velvety darkness, seeking something
that she hoped for, trembling before something that
brought her dread.</p>

<p>His voice was as the voice of spring when it breathes
on the sleeping earth; he knew each note in Love&rsquo;s
music, every word in the great thing that is Love&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg&nbsp;54]</a></span>
vocabulary. Love loved, and Psyche listened, and soon
she knew that her lover was Love himself.</p>

<p>Thus, for Psyche, did a time of perfect happiness
begin. All through the day she roamed in her Love&rsquo;s
dominion, and saw on every side the signs of his passion
and of his tenderness. All through the night he stayed
by her, and satisfied all the longing of her heart. Yet
always, ere daybreak, Eros left her, and when she begged
him to stay he only made answer:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;I am with thee only while I keep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My visage hidden; and if thou once shouldst see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My face, I must forsake thee; the high gods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Link Love with Faith, and he withdraws himself<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the full gaze of knowledge.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Lewis Morris.</span></p>

<p>So did time glide past for Psyche, and ever she grew
more in love with Love; always did her happiness become
more complete. Yet, ever and again, there
returned to her the remembrance of those sorrowful days
when her father and mother had broken their hearts
over her martyrdom, and her sisters had looked askance
at her as at one whose punishment must assuredly
have come from her own misdoing. Thus at length she
asked Eros to grant her, for love&rsquo;s sake, a boon&mdash;to
permit her to have her sisters come to see for themselves
the happiness that was hers. Most unwillingly
was her request granted, for the heart of Eros told him
that from their visit no good could come. Yet he was
unable to deny anything to Psyche, and on the following
day Zephyrus was sent to bring the two sisters to
the pleasant valley where Psyche had her home.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg&nbsp;55]</a></span>
Eagerly, as she awaited them, Psyche thought she
might make the princely palace wherein she dwelt yet
fairer than it was. And almost ere she could think,
her thoughts became realities. When the two sisters
came, they were bewildered with the beauty and the
magnificence of it all. Beside this, their own possessions
were paltry trifles indeed. Quickly, in their little
hearts, black envy grew. They had always been jealous of
their younger sister, and now that they found her, whom
all the world believed to have been slain by a horrible
monster, more beautiful than ever, decked with rare
jewels, radiant in her happiness, and queen of a palace
fit for the gods, their envy soon turned to hatred, and
they sought how best to wreak their malice upon the
joyous creature who loaded them with priceless gifts.
They began to ply Psyche with questions. He who was
her lord, to whom she owed all her happiness, where was
he? Why did he stay away when her sisters came to be
presented to him? What manner of man was he?
Was he fair or dark? Young or old? And as they
questioned her, Psyche grew like a bewildered child
and answered in frightened words that contradicted one
another. And well the wicked sisters, who brooded evil
in their hearts, knew that this husband whom Psyche
had never seen must indeed be one of the deathless gods.
Wily words they spoke to her then.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas! unhappy one,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;dost think to
escape the evil fate the gods meted out for thee? Thy
husband is none other than the monster of which the
oracle spake! Oh, foolish Psyche! canst not understand
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg&nbsp;56]</a></span>
that the monster fears the light? Too great horror would
it mean for thee to see the loathsome thing that comes in
the blackness of night and speaks to thee words of love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>White-lipped and trembling, Psyche listened. Drop
by drop the poisonous words passed into her soul. She
had thought him king of all living things&mdash;worthy to
rule over gods as well as men. She was so sure that his
body was worthy sheath for the heart she knew so
well.... She had pictured him beautiful as Eros,
son of Aphrodite&mdash;young and fair, with crisp, golden
locks&mdash;a husband to glory in&mdash;a lover to adore. And
now she knew, with shame and dread, that he who had
won her love between the twilight and the dawn was a
thing to shame her, a monster to be shunned of men.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, then, shall I do?&rdquo; piteously she asked of
her sisters. And the women, pitilessly, and well content,
answered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Provide thyself with a lamp and a knife sharp
enough to slay the man or monster. And when this
creature to whom, to thy undying shame, thou belongest,
sleeps sound, slip from thy couch and in the
rays of the lamp have courage to look upon him in all
his horror. Then, when thou hast seen for thyself that
what we say is truth, with thy knife swiftly slay him.
Thus shalt thou free thyself from the pitiless doom
meted out by the gods.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shaking with sobs, Psyche made answer:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I love him so!... I love him so!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And her sisters turned upon her with furious scorn
and well-simulated wrath.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg&nbsp;57]</a></span>
&ldquo;Shameless one!&rdquo; they cried; &ldquo;and does our
father&rsquo;s daughter confess to a thing so unutterable!
Only by slaying the monster canst thou hope to regain
thy place amongst the daughters of men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They left her when evening fell, carrying with them
their royal gifts. And while she awaited the coming of
her lord, Psyche, provided with knife and lamp, crouched
with her head in her hands, a lily broken by a cruel storm.
So glad was Eros to come back to her, to find her safely
there&mdash;for greatly had he feared the coming of that
treacherous pair&mdash;that he did not note her silence. Nor
did the dark night show him that her eyes in her sad
face looked like violets in a snow wreath. He wanted
only to hold her safely in his arms, and there she lay,
passive and still, until sleep came to lay upon him an
omnipotent hand. Then, very gently, she withdrew
herself from his embrace, and stole to the place where
her lamp was hidden. Her limbs shook under her as
she brought it to the couch where he lay asleep; her
arm trembled as she held it aloft.</p>

<p>As a martyr walks to death, so did she walk. And
when the yellow light fell upon the form of him who lay
there, still she gazed steadily.</p>

<p>And, lo, before her she saw the form of him who had
ever been the ideal of her dreams. Love himself, incarnate
Love, perfect in beauty and in all else was he
whom her sisters had told her was a monster&mdash;he, of
whom the oracle had said that neither gods nor men
could resist him. For a moment of perfect happiness
she gazed upon his beauty. Then he turned in his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg&nbsp;58]</a></span>
sleep, and smiled, and stretched out his arms to find
the one of his love. And Psyche started, and, starting,
shook the lamp; and from it fell a drop of burning oil
on the white shoulder of Eros. At once he awoke, and
with piteous, pitying eyes looked in those of Psyche.
And when he spoke, his words were like daggers that
pierced deep into her soul. He told her all that had
been, all that might have been. Had she only had
faith and patience to wait, an immortal life should have
been hers.</p>

<p>He left her alone then, with her despair, and as the
slow hours dragged by, Psyche, as she awaited the
dawn, felt that in her heart no sun could ever rise again.
When day came at last, she felt she could no longer
endure to stay in the palace where everything spoke to
her of the infinite tenderness of a lost love. Through
the night a storm had raged, and even with the day
there came no calm. And Psyche, weary and chill,
wandered away from the place of her happiness, onward
and ever on, until she stood on the bank of a
swift-flowing river. For a little she stayed her steps
and listened to the sound of its wash against the rocks
and tree roots as it hurried past, and to her as she waited
came the thought that here had she found a means by
which to end her woe.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg&nbsp;59]</a></span>
&ldquo;I have lost my Love,&rdquo; she moaned. &ldquo;What
is Life to me any longer! Come to me then, O
Death!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So then she sprang into the wan water, hoping that
very swiftly it might bear her grief-worn soul down to
the shades. But the river bore her up and carried her
to its shallows in a fair meadow where Pan himself sat
on the bank and merrily dabbled his feet in the flowing
water. And when Psyche, shamed and wet, looked at
him with sad eyes, the god spoke to her gently and
chid her for her folly. She was too young and much too
fair to try to end her life so rudely, he said. The river
gods would never be so unkind as to drive so beautiful
a maiden in rough haste down to the Cocytus valley.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thou must dree thy weird like all other daughters of
men, fair Psyche,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He or she who fain would
lose their lives, are ever held longest in life. Only when
the gods will it shall thy days on earth be done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Psyche, knowing that in truth the gods had
spared her to endure more sorrow, looked in his face
with a very piteous gaze, and wandered on. As she
wandered, she found that her feet had led her near the
place where her two sisters dwelt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall tell them of the evil they have wrought,&rdquo;
she thought. &ldquo;Surely they must sorrow when they
know that by their cruel words they stole my faith from
me and robbed me of my Love and of my happiness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gladly the two women saw the stricken form of
Psyche and looked at her face, all marred by grief.
Well, indeed, had their plot succeeded; their malice
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg&nbsp;60]</a></span>
had drunk deep, yet deeper still they drank, for with
scornful laughter they drove her from their palace doors.
Very quickly, when she had gone, the elder sought the
place where she had stood when Zephyrus bore her in
safety to that palace of pleasure where Psyche dwelt
with her Love. Now that Psyche was no longer there,
surely the god by whom she had been beloved would
gladly have as her successor the beautiful woman who
was now much more fair than the white-faced girl with
eyes all red with weeping. And such certainty did the
vengeful gods put in her heart that she held out her
arms, and calling aloud:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bear me to him in thine arms, Zephyrus! Behold
I come, my lord!&rdquo; she sprang from the high cliff on
which she stood, into space. And the ravens that night
feasted on her shattered body. So also did it befall the
younger sister, deluded by the Olympians to her own
destruction, so that her sin might be avenged.</p>

<p>For many a weary day and night Psyche wandered,
ever seeking to find her Love, ever longing to do something
by which to atone for the deed that had been her
undoing. From temple to temple she went, but nowhere
did she come near him, until at length in Cyprus
she came to the place where Aphrodite herself had her
dwelling. And inasmuch as her love had made her very
bold, and because she no longer feared death, nor could
think of pangs more cruel than those that she already
knew, Psyche sought the presence of the goddess who
was her enemy, and humbly begged her to take her
life away.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg&nbsp;61]</a></span>
With flaming scorn and anger Aphrodite received her.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;O thou fool,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I will not let thee die!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But thou shalt reap the harvest thou hast sown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many a day that wretched lot bemoan;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou art my slave, and not a day shall be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I will find some fitting task for thee.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>There began then for Psyche a time of torturing
misery of which only those could speak who have knowledge
of the merciless stripes with which the goddess
can scourge the hearts of her slaves. With cruel ingenuity,
Aphrodite invented labours for her.</p>

<p>In uncountable quantity, and mingled in inextricable
and bewildering confusion, there lay in the granary of
the goddess grains of barley and of wheat, peas and
millet, poppy and coriander seed. To sort out each
kind and lay them in heaps was the task allotted for one
day, and woe be to her did she fail. In despair, Psyche
began her hopeless labour. While the sun shone,
through a day that was for her too short, she strove to
separate the grains, but when the shadows of evening
made it hard for her to distinguish one sort from another,
only a few very tiny piles were the result of her weary
toil. Very soon the goddess would return, and Psyche
dared not think what would be the punishment meted
out to her. Rapidly the darkness fell, but while the
dying light still lingered in some parts of the granary,
it seemed to Psyche as though little dark trickles of
water began to pour from underneath the doors and
through the cracks in the wall. Trembling she watched
the ceaseless motion of those long, dark lines, and then,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg&nbsp;62]</a></span>
in amazement, realised that what she saw were unending
processions of ants. And as though one who loved her
directed their labours, the millions of busy little toilers
swiftly did for Psyche what she herself had failed to do.
When at length they went away, in those long dark
lines that looked like the flow of a thread-like stream,
the grains were all piled up in high heaps, and the sad
heart of Psyche knew not only thankful relief, but had
a thrill of gladness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eros sent them to me:&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;Even
yet his love for me is not dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And what she thought was true.</p>

<p>Amazed and angry, Aphrodite looked at the task
she had deemed impossible, well and swiftly performed.
That Psyche should possess such magic skill only incensed
her more, and next day she said to her new
slave:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Behold, on the other side of that glittering stream,
my golden-fleeced sheep crop the sweet flowers of the
meadow. To-day must thou cross the river and bring
me back by evening a sample of wool pulled from each
one of their shining fleeces.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then did Psyche go down to the brink of the river,
and even as her white feet splashed into the water, she
heard a whisper of warning from the reeds that bowed
their heads by the stream.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beware! O Psyche,&rdquo; they said. &ldquo;Stay on the
shore and rest until the golden-fleeced sheep lie under
the shade of the trees in the evening and the murmur
of the river has lulled them to sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg&nbsp;63]</a></span>
But Psyche said, &ldquo;Alas, I must do the bidding of the
goddess. It will take me many a weary hour to pluck
the wool that she requires.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And again the reeds murmured, &ldquo;Beware! for the
golden-fleeced sheep, with their great horns, are evil
creatures that lust for the lives of mortals, and will slay
thee even as thy feet reach the other bank. Only when
the sun goes down does their vice depart from them,
and while they sleep thou canst gather of their wool
from the bushes and from the trunks of the trees.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And again the heart of Psyche felt a thrill of happiness,
because she knew that she was loved and cared for
still. All day she rested in the wood by the river and
dreamt pleasant day-dreams, and when the sun had set
she waded to the further shore and gathered the golden
wool in the way that the reeds had told her. When in
the evening she came to the goddess, bearing her shining
load, the brow of Aphrodite grew dark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If thou art so skilled in magic that no danger is
danger to thee, yet another task shall I give thee that is
worthy of thy skill,&rdquo; she said, and laid upon Psyche her
fresh commands.</p>

<p>Sick with dread, Psyche set out next morning to seek
the black stream out of which Aphrodite had commanded
her to fill a ewer. Part of its waters flowed into the
Styx, part into the Cocytus, and well did Psyche know
that a hideous death from the loathly creatures that
protected the fountain must be the fate of those who
risked so proud an attempt. Yet because she knew
that she must &ldquo;dree her weird,&rdquo; as Pan had said, she
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg&nbsp;64]</a></span>
plodded onward, towards that dark mountain from
whose side gushed the black water that she sought.
And then, once again, there came to her a message of
love. A whirring of wings she heard, and</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;O&rsquo;er her head there flew the bird of Jove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bearer, of his servant, friend of Love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, when he saw her, straightway towards her flew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And asked her why she wept, and when he knew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And who she was, he said, &lsquo;Cease all thy fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For to the black waves I thy ewer will bear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fill it for thee; but, remember me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When thou art come unto thy majesty.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>And, yet once again, the stricken heart of Psyche was
gladdened, and when at nightfall she came with her
ewer full of water from the dread stream and gave
it to Aphrodite, although she knew that a yet more
arduous task was sure to follow, her fear had all passed
away.</p>

<p>With beautiful, sullen eyes, Aphrodite received her
when she brought the water. And, with black brow,
she said: &ldquo;If thou art so skilled in magic that no
danger is known to thee, I shall now give thee a task
all worthy of thy skill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thereon she told her that she must seek that dark
valley where no silver nor golden light ever strikes on
the black waters of Cocytus and of the Styx; and where
Pluto reigns in gloomy majesty over the restless shades.
From Proserpine she was to crave for Aphrodite the
gift of a box of magical ointment, the secret of which
was known to the Queen of Darkness alone, and which
was able to bring to those who used it, beauty more
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg&nbsp;65]</a></span>
exquisite than any that the eyes of gods or of men had
as yet looked upon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I grow weary and careworn,&rdquo; said Aphrodite, and
she looked like a rose that has budded in Paradise as she
spoke. &ldquo;My son was wounded by a faithless slave in
whom, most weakly, he put his trust, and in tending
to his wound, my beauty has faded.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And at these scornful words, the heart of Psyche
leaped within her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In helping his mother, I shall help him!&rdquo; she
thought. And again she thought, &ldquo;I shall atone.&rdquo; And
so, when day was come, she took her way along the
weary road that leads to that dark place from whence
no traveller can ever hope to return, and still with
gladness in her heart. But, as she went onward, &ldquo;cold
thoughts and dreadful fears&rdquo; came to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better were it for me to hasten my journey to the
shades,&rdquo; she thought.</p>

<p>And when she came to an old grey tower, that seemed
like an old man that Death has forgotten, she resolved to
throw herself down from it, and thus swiftly to find herself
at her journey&rsquo;s end. But as she stood on the top of
the tower, her arms outstretched, like a white butterfly
that poises its wings for flight, a voice spoke in her ear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, foolish one,&rdquo; it said, &ldquo;why dost thou strive
to stay the hope that is not dead?&rdquo; And while she held
her breath, her great eyes wide open, the voice spoke on,
and told her by what means she might speedily reach
Hades and there find means to face with courage the
King of Darkness himself and his fair wife, Proserpine.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg&nbsp;66]</a></span>
All that she was bidden to do, Psyche did, and so
at last did she come before the throne of Proserpine,
and all that Psyche endured, all that she saw, all that
through which she came with bleeding heart and yet
with unscathed soul, cannot here be written.</p>

<p>To her Proserpine gave the box of precious ointment
that Aphrodite described, and gladly she hastened homeward.
Good, indeed, it was to her when again she
reached the fair light of day. Yet, when she had won
there, there came to Psyche a winged thought, that
beat against the stern barriers of her mind like a little
moth against a window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This ointment that I carry with me,&rdquo; said Psyche
to herself, &ldquo;is an ointment that will bring back to those
all faded by time, or worn by suffering, a beauty greater
than any beauty that has joyed the Immortals!&rdquo;
And then she thought:</p>

<p>&ldquo;For my beauty, Eros&mdash;<em>Love</em>&mdash;loved me; and now
my beauty is worn and wasted and well-nigh gone.
Were I to open this box and make use of the ointment
of Proserpine, then indeed I should be fair enough to be
the bride of him who, even now, believes that he loves
me&mdash;of Eros whose love is my life!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So it came to pass that she opened the fateful box.
And out of it there came not Beauty, but Sleep, that
put his gyves upon her limbs, and on her eyelids laid
heavy fingers. And Psyche sank down by the wayside,
the prisoner of Sleep.</p>

<p>But Eros, who had loved her ever, with a love that
knew the ebb and flow of no tides, rose from his bed and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg&nbsp;67]</a></span>
went in search of her who had braved even the horrors
of Hades for his dear sake. And by the wayside he
found her, fettered by sleep. Her little oval face was white
as a snowdrop. Like violets were her heavy eyelids,
and underneath her sleeping eyes a violet shadow lay.
Once had her mouth been as the bow of Eros, painted
in carmine. Now either end of the bow was turned
downwards, and its colour was that of a faded rose-leaf.</p>

<p>And as Eros looked at her that he loved, pity stirred
his heart, as the wind sweeps through the sighing,
grey leaves of the willow, or sings through the bowing
reeds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My <em>Belov&egrave;d</em>!&rdquo; he said, and he knew that Psyche
was indeed his beloved. It was her fair soul that he
loved, nor did it matter to him whether her body
was like a rose in June or as a wind-scourged tree in
December. And as his lips met hers, Psyche awoke,
and heard his soft whisper:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">&ldquo;Dear, unclose thine eyes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou mayst look on me now. I go no more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But am thine own forever.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Lewis Morris.</span></p>

<p>Then did there spring from the fair white shoulders
of Psyche, wings of silver and of gold, and, hand in
hand with Eros, she winged her way to Olympus.</p>

<p>And there all the deathless gods were assembled,
and Aphrodite no longer looked upon her who had
once been her slave with darkened brows, but smiled
upon her as the sun smiles upon a new-born flower. And
when into the hand of Psyche there was placed a cup
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg&nbsp;68]</a></span>
of gold, the voice of the great Father and King of
Olympus rang out loud and clear:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Drink now, O beautiful, and have no fear!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For with this draught shalt thou be born again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And live for ever free from care and pain.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">William Morris.</span></p>

<p>In this wise did Psyche, a human soul, attain by bitter
suffering to the perfect happiness of purified love.</p>

<p>And still do we watch the butterfly, which is her
emblem, bursting from its ugly tomb in the dark soil,
and spreading joyous white and gold-powdered wings
in the caressing sunshine, amidst the radiance and the
fragrance of the summer flowers. Still, too, do we sadly
watch her sister, the white moth, heedlessly rushing
into pangs unutterable, thoughtlessly seeking the anguish
that brings her a cruel death.</p>

<h2>THE CALYDONIAN HUNT</h2>


<p>&OElig;neus and Alth&aelig;a were king and queen of Calydon, and
to them was born a son who was his mother&rsquo;s joy and
yet her bitterest sorrow. Meleager was his name, and
ere his birth his mother dreamed a dream that the child
that she bore was a burning firebrand. But when the
baby came he was a royal child indeed, a little fearless
king from the first moment that his eyes, like unseeing
violets, gazed steadily up at his mother. To the chamber
where he lay by his mother&rsquo;s side came the three Fates,
spinning, ceaselessly spinning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He shall be strong,&rdquo; said one, as she span her
thread. &ldquo;He shall be fortunate and brave,&rdquo; said the
second. But the third laid a billet of wood on the
flames, and while her withered fingers held the fatal
threads, she looked with old, old, sad eyes at the new-born
child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To thee, O New-Born,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and to this wood
that burns, do we give the same span of days to
live.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From her bed sprang Alth&aelig;a, and, heedless of the
flames, she seized the burning wood, trod on it with her
fair white feet, and poured on it water that swiftly
quenched its red glow. &ldquo;Thou shalt live forever, O
Beloved,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;for never again shall fire char the
brand that I have plucked from the burning.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg&nbsp;70]</a></span>
And the baby laughed.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Those grey women with bound hair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who fright the gods frighted not him; he laughed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seeing them, and pushed out hands to feel and haul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Distaff and thread.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>The years sped on, and from fearless and beautiful
babyhood, Meleager grew into gallant boyhood, and
then into magnificent youth. When Jason and his
heroes sailed away into a distant land to win the Golden
Fleece, Meleager was one of the noble band. From all
men living he won great praise for his brave deeds, and
when the tribes of the north and west made war upon
&AElig;tolia, he fought against their army and scattered it as
a wind in autumn drives the fallen leaves before it.</p>

<p>But his victory brought evil upon him. When his father
&OElig;neus, at the end of a fruitful year, offered sacrifices to
the gods, he omitted to honour the goddess Diana by
sacrificing to her, and to punish his neglect, she had sent
this destroying army. When Meleager was victor, her
wrath against his father grew yet more hot, and she
sent a wild boar, large as the bulls of Epirus, and fierce
and savage to kill and to devour, that it might ravage
and lay waste the land of Calydon. The fields of corn
were trampled under foot, the vineyards laid waste, and
the olive groves wrecked as by a winter hurricane.
Flocks and herds were slaughtered by it, or driven
hither and thither in wild panic, working havoc as they
fled. Many went out to slay it, but went only to find
a hideous death. Then did Meleager resolve that he
would rid the land of this monster, and called on all his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg&nbsp;71]</a></span>
friends, the heroes of Greece, to come to his aid. Theseus
and his friend Pirithous came; Jason; Peleus, afterwards
father of Achilles; Telamon, the father of Ajax;
Nestor, then but a youth; Castor and Pollux, and Toxeus
and Plexippus, the brothers of Alth&aelig;a, the fair queen-mother.
But there came none more fearless nor more
ready to fight the monster boar of Calydon than Atalanta,
the daughter of the king of Arcadia. When
Atalanta was born, her father heard of her birth with
anger. He desired no daughter, but only sturdy sons
who might fight for him, and in the furious rage of bitter
disappointment he had the baby princess left on the
Parthenian Hill that she might perish there. A she-bear
heard the baby&rsquo;s piteous cries, and carried it off
to its lair, where she suckled it along with her young,
and there the little Atalanta tumbled about and played
with her furry companions and grew strong and vigorous
as any other wild young creature of the forest.</p>

<p>Some hunters came one day to raid the den and kill
the foster-mother, and found, amazed, a fearless, white-skinned
thing with rosy cheeks and brave eyes, who
fought for her life and bit them as did her fierce foster-brothers,
and then cried human tears of rage and sorrow
when she saw the bear who had been her mother lying
bloody and dead. Under the care of the hunters
Atalanta grew into a maiden, with all the beauty of a
maid and all the strength and the courage of a man.
She ran as swiftly as Zephyrus runs when he rushes up
from the west and drives the white clouds before him
like a flock of timid fawns that a hound is pursuing.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg&nbsp;72]</a></span>
The shafts that her strong arm sped from her bow smote
straight to the heart of the beast that she chased, and
almost as swift as her arrow was she there to drive her
spear into her quarry. When at length her father
the king learned that the beautiful huntress, of whom
all men spoke as of one only a little lower than Diana,
was none other than his daughter, he was not slow to
own her as his child. So proud was he of her beauty
and grace, and of her marvellous swiftness of foot and skill
in the chase, that he would fain have married her to one
of the great ones of Greece, but Atalanta had consulted
an oracle. &ldquo;Marry not,&rdquo; said the oracle. &ldquo;To thee
marriage must bring woe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So, with untouched heart, and with the daring and
the courage of a young lad, Atalanta came along with the
heroes to the Calydonian Hunt. She was so radiantly
lovely, so young, so strong, so courageous, that straightway
Meleager loved her, and all the heroes gazed at her
with eyes that adored her beauty. And Diana, looking
down at her, also loved the maiden whom from childhood
she had held in her protection&mdash;a gallant, fearless virgin
dear to her heart.</p>

<p>The grey mist rose from the marshes as the hunt
began, and the hunters of the boar had gone but a
little way when they came upon traces of the hated
boar. Disembowelled beasts marked its track. Here,
in a flowery meadow, had it wallowed. There, in rich
wheat land, had it routed, and the marks of its bestial
tusks were on the gashed grey trunks of the trees that
had once lived in the peace of a fruitful olive grove.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg&nbsp;73]</a></span>
In a marsh they found their enemy, and all the reeds
quivered as it heaved its vast bulk and hove aside the weed
in which it had wallowed, and rooted with its tusks
amongst the wounded water-lilies before it leapt with a
snort to meet and to slay the men who had come against
it. A filthy thing it was, as its pink snout rose above
the green ooze of the marshes, and it looked up lustingly,
defying the purity of the blue skies of heaven, to bring
to those who came against it a cruel, shameful death.</p>

<p>Upon it, first of all, Jason cast his spear. But the
sharp point only touched it, and unwounded, the boar
rushed on, its gross, bristly head down, to disembowel,
if it could, the gallant Nestor. In the branches of a tree
Nestor found safety, and Telamon rushed on to destroy
the filthy thing that would have made carrion of the sons
of the gods. A straggling cypress root caught his fleeting
foot and laid him prone, a helpless prey for the rooting
brute. His hounds fell before it, but ere it could reach
him, Atalanta, full of vengeful rage&mdash;the pure angered
against the filthy and cruel&mdash;let draw her bow, with a
prayer to Diana to guide her shaft aright. Into the
boar&rsquo;s smoking flank sped the arrow.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i7">&ldquo;The sudden string<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rang, and sprang inward, and the waterish air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hissed, and the moist plumes of the songless reeds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Moved as a wave which the wind moves no more.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the boar heaved half out of ooze and slime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His tense flank trembling round the barbed wound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hateful; and fiery with invasive eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bristling with intolerable hair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Plunged, and the hounds clung, and green flowers and white<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reddened and broke all round them where they came.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg&nbsp;74]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And charging with sheer tusk he drove, and smote<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hyleus; and sharp death caught his sudden soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And violent sleep shed night upon his eyes.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Swinburne.</span></p>

<p>More than ever terrible was the monster now that
it was wounded. One after the other the hunters
fell before its mad rage, and were sent to the shades
by a bloody and merciless death.</p>

<p>Before its furious charge even the heart of a hero
might have been stricken. Yet Meleager, like a mighty
oak of the forest that will not sway even a little before
the rush of a storm, stood full in its way and met its
onslaught.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Aimed on the left side his well-handled spear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grasped where the ash was knottiest hewn, and smote,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with no missile wound, the monstrous boar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Right in the hairiest hollow of his hide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under the last rib, sheer through bulk and bone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep in; and deeply smitten, and to death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The heavy horror with his hanging shafts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leapt, and fell furiously, and from raging lips<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Foamed out the latest wrath of all his life.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Great was the shout that rose from those who still
lived when that grim hunt thus came to an end. And
when, with his keen blade, Meleager struck off the head,
even as the quivering throat drew its last agonised
breath, louder still shouted the men of Greece. But
not for himself did Meleager despoil the body of his foe.
He laid the ugly thing at the feet of Atalanta.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is thy spoil, not mine,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The
wounding shaft was sped by thee. To thee belongs the
praise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Atalanta blushed rosily, and laughed low and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg&nbsp;75]</a></span>
gladly, not only because Diana had heard her prayer
and helped her slay the beast, but for happiness that
Meleager was so noble in his giving.</p>

<p>At that the brows of the heroes grew dark, and
angrily one cried:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i11">&ldquo;Lo, now,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall not the Arcadian shoot out lips at us,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saying all we were despoiled by this one girl.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Like a spark that kindles the dry grass, their kindling
anger spread, and they rushed against Atalanta, seized
the trophy she had been given, and smote her as though
she were but a shameless wanton and not the noble
daughter of a king.</p>

<p>And because the heart of Meleager was given very
wholly to the fair huntress, and because those whom he
deemed his friends had not only dishonoured her, but had
done him a very grievous wrong, a great rage seized him.
Right and left he smote, and they who had been most
bitter in their jealousy of Atalanta, the two brothers of
his own mother, were laid low in death.</p>

<p>Tidings of the slaying of the boar had been brought
to Alth&aelig;a by swift messengers, and she was on her way
to the temples bearing gifts to the gods for the victory
of her son, when she beheld the slow-footed procession
of those who bore the bodies of the dead. And when
she saw the still faces of her two dear brothers, quickly
was her joy turned into mourning. Terrible was her
grief and anger when she learned by whose hand they
were slain, and her mother&rsquo;s love and pride dried up in
her heart like the clear water of a fountain before the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg&nbsp;76]</a></span>
scorching of a devouring fire. No sacrifices to the gods
would she offer, but her dead brothers should have the
greatest sacrifice that mother could make to atone for
the guilt of her son. Back to the palace she went, and
from its safe hiding-place drew out the brand that she
had rescued from the flames when Meleager the hero
was but a babe that made his mother&rsquo;s heart sing for
joy. She commanded a fire to be prepared, and four
times, as its flames blazed aloft, she tried to lay the brand
upon the pile. Yet four times she drew back, and then
at last she threw into the reddest of the ashes the charred
brand that for a little she held so close to her breast
that it seemed as though she fondled her child.</p>

<p>A wreath of leaves as sign of victory was being
placed on Atalanta&rsquo;s beautiful head by the adoring
hands of Meleager when his mother gave him his doom.
Through his body there rushed a pang of mortal agony.
His blood turned to fire, and the hand of Death that
smote him was as a hand of molten lead. In torture his
gallant spirit passed away, uncomplaining, loving through
his pain the maid for whose dear sake he had brought
woe upon himself. As the last white ashes in the fire
crumbled and fell away into nothingness, the soul of
Meleager departed. Swiftly through the dark valley his
mother&rsquo;s shade followed him, for she fell upon a sword
and so perished. And Diana, looking down on the grief-stricken
sisters of Meleager and on the bitter sorrow of
his father, had compassion on them and turned them
into birds.</p>

<p>So ended the Calydonian Hunt, and Atalanta
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg&nbsp;77]</a></span>
returned to Arcadia, heavy at heart for the evil she had
wrought unwittingly. And still the Three Fates span
on, and the winds caught up the cold wood ashes and
blew them across the ravaged land that Meleager had
saved and that quickly grew fertile again.</p>

<h2>ATALANTA</h2>


<p>Atalanta, daughter of the king of Arcadia, returned
sad at heart to her own land. Only as comrades, as
those against whose skill in the chase she was wont to pit
her own skill, had she looked upon men. But Meleager,
the hero who loved her and her fair honour more than
life itself, and whose love had made him haste in all his
gallant strength and youthful beauty to the land of the
Shades, was one to touch her as never before had she
been touched. Her father, proud of her triumph in
Calydon, again besought her to marry one of her many
noble suitors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If indeed they love me as thou sayest,&rdquo; said
Atalanta to her father, &ldquo;then must they be ready to
face for my sake even the loss of dear life itself. I shall
be the prize of him who outruns me in a foot-race. But
he who tries and fails, must pay to Death his penalty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thereafter, for many days, a strange sight was to be
seen in Arcadia. For one after another the suitors came
to race with the maiden whose face had bewitched them,
though truly the race was no more fair to him who
ran than would be a race with Death. No mortal man
was as fleet as Atalanta, who had first raced with the
wild things of the mountains and the forests, and who
had dared at last to race with the winds and leave even
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg&nbsp;79]</a></span>
them behind. To her it was all a glorious game. Her
conquest was always sure, and if the youths who entered
in the contest cared to risk their lives, why should they
blame her? So each day they started, throbbing hope
and fierce determination to win her in the heart of him
who ran&mdash;fading hope and despairing anger as he saw
her skimming ahead of him like a gay-hued butterfly
that a tired child pursues in vain. And each day, as the
race ended, another man paid the price of his defeat.</p>

<p>Daily, amongst those who looked on, stood her
cousin Milanion. He would fain have hated Atalanta
for her ruthlessness and her joyousness as he saw his
friends die for her sake, yet daily her beauty, her purity,
and her gallant unconsciousness took a firmer hold upon
his heart. To himself he vowed that he would win
Atalanta, but not without help from the gods was this
possible. Therefore he sought Aphrodite herself and
asked her aid.</p>

<p>Milanion was a beautiful youth, and to Aphrodite, who
loved beauty, he pled his cause as he told her how Atalanta
had become to him more than life, so that he had
ceased to pity the youths, his friends, who had died for
love of her. The goddess smiled upon him with gentle
sympathy.</p>

<p>In the garden of her temple grew a tree with branches
and twigs of gold, and leaves as yellow as the little leaves
of the silver birch when the autumn sun kisses them as
it sets. On this tree grew golden apples, and Aphrodite
plucked three of them and gave them to the youth who
had not feared to ask her to aid him to win the maid he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg&nbsp;80]</a></span>
loved. How he was to use the apples she then told
him, and, well content, Milanion returned home.</p>

<p>Next day he spoke to Atalanta.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So far has victory been thine, Fairest on earth,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;but so far have thy little winged white feet had
only the heavy-footed laggards to outrun. Wilt have me
run a race with thee? for assuredly I shall win thee for
my own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Milanion looked into the eyes of Atalanta with
a smile as gay and fearless as that with which a hero is
wont to look in the eyes of his fellow.</p>

<p>Look for look did the virgin huntress give him.</p>

<p>Then her cheeks grew red, as though the rosy-fingered
dawn had touched them, and the dawning of
love came into her heart.</p>

<p>Even Meleager was not quite so goodly a youth as
this. Not even Meleager had been so wholly fearless.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thou art tempted by the deathless gods,&rdquo; she
said, but her long lashes drooped on her cheek as she
spoke. &ldquo;I pity you, Milanion, for when thou dost race
with me, the goal is assuredly the meadows of asphodel
near where sit Pluto and Persephone on their gloomy
thrones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Milanion said, &ldquo;I am ready, Atalanta. Wilt
race with me now?&rdquo; And steadily he looked in her
eyes until again they fell as though at last they had
found a conqueror.</p>

<p>Like two swallows that skim across a sunny sea,
filled with the joyousness of the coming of spring,
Atalanta and Milanion started. Scarcely did their feet
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg&nbsp;81]</a></span>
seem to touch the solid earth, and all those who stood
by vowed that now, at length, was a race indeed, a race
worthy for the gods to behold.</p>

<span class="caption">SHE STOPPED, AND PICKED UP THE TREASURE</span>
</div>

<p>But as they ran, almost abreast, so that none could
tell which was the gainer, Milanion obeyed the bidding
of Aphrodite and let fall one of the golden apples. Never
before had Atalanta dreamed of such a thing&mdash;an apple
of glistening gold! She stopped, poised on one foot as a
flying bird poises for a moment on the wing, and picked
up the treasure. But Milanion had sped several paces
ahead ere she was again abreast of him, and even as she
gained on him, he dropped the second apple. Again
Atalanta was tempted. Again she stopped, and again
Milanion shot ahead of her. Her breath came short
and fast, as once more she gained the ground that she
had lost. But, yet a third time, Milanion threw in her
way one of the golden illusions of the gods. And, yet
again, Atalanta stooped to pick up the apple of gold.</p>

<p>Then a mighty shout from those who watched rent
the air, and Atalanta, half fearful, half ashamed, yet
wholly happy, found herself running, vanquished, into
the arms of him who was indeed her conqueror. For
not only had Milanion won the race, but he had won
the heart of the virgin huntress, a heart once as cold
and remote as the winter snow on the peak of Mount
Olympus.</p>

<h2>ARACHNE</h2>


<p>The hay that so short a time ago was long, lush grass,
with fragrant meadow-sweet and gold-eyed marguerites
growing amongst it in the green meadow-land by the
river, is now dry hay&mdash;fragrant still, though dead, and
hidden from the sun&rsquo;s warm rays underneath the dark
wooden rafters of the barn. Occasionally a cat on a
hunting foray comes into the barn to look for mice, or
to nestle cosily down into purring slumber. Now and
then a hen comes furtively tip-toeing through the open
door and makes for itself a secret nest in which to lay
the eggs which it subsequently heralds with such loud
clucks of proud rejoicing as to completely undo all its
previous precautions. Sometimes children come in, pursuing
cat or hen, or merely to tumble each other over
amongst the soft hay which they leave in chaotic confusion,
and when they have gone away, a little more of
the sky can be seen through the little window in the roof,
and through the wooden bars of the window lower down.
Yet, whatever other living creatures may come or go, by
those windows of the barn, and high up on its dark
rafters, there is always a living creature working, ceaselessly
working. When, through the skylight, the sun-god
drives a golden sunbeam, and a long shaft of dancing
dust-atoms passes from the window to what was once a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg&nbsp;83]</a></span>
part of the early summer&rsquo;s glory, the work of the unresting
toiler is also to be seen, for the window is hung
with shimmering grey tapestries made by Arachne, the
spider, and from rafter to rafter her threads are suspended
with inimitable skill.</p>

<p>She was a nymph once, they say&mdash;the daughter of
Idmon the dyer, of Colophon, a city of Lydia. In all
Lydia there was none who could weave as wove the
beautiful Arachne. To watch her card the wool of the
white-fleeced sheep until in her fingers it grew like the
soft clouds that hang round the hill tops, was pleasure
enough to draw nymphs from the golden river Pactolus
and from the vineyards of Tymolus. And when she
drove her swift shuttle hither and thither, still it was
joy to watch her wondrous skill. Magical was the
growth of the web, fine of woof, that her darting fingers
span, and yet more magical the exquisite devices that
she then wrought upon it. For birds and flowers and
butterflies and pictures of all the beautiful things on
earth were limned by Arachne, and old tales grew alive
again under her creative needle.</p>

<p>To Pallas Athen&eacute;, goddess of craftsmen, came tidings
that at Colophon in Lydia lived a nymph whose skill
rivalled that of the goddess herself, and she, ever jealous
for her own honour, took on herself the form of a woman
bent with age, and, leaning on her staff, joined the little
crowd that hung round Arachne as she plied her busy
needle. With white arms twined round each other the
eager nymphs watched the flowers spring up under her
fingers, even as flowers spring from the ground on the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg&nbsp;84]</a></span>
coming of Demeter, and Athen&eacute; was fain to admire, while
she marvelled at the magic skill of the fair Arachne.</p>

<p>Gently she spoke to Arachne, and, with the persuasive
words of a wise old woman, warned her that she
must not let her ambition soar too high. Greater than
all skilled craftswomen was the great goddess Athen&eacute;,
and were Arachne, in impious vanity, to dream that one
day she might equal her, that were indeed a crime for
any god to punish.</p>

<p>Glancing up for a moment from the picture whose
perfect colours grew fast under her slim fingers, Arachne
fixed scornful eyes on the old woman and gave a merry
laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didst say <em>equal</em> Athen&eacute;? old mother,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;In good sooth thy dwelling must be with the goat-herds
in the far-off hills and thou art not a dweller in our
city. Else hadst thou not spoken to Arachne of <em>equalling</em>
the work of Athen&eacute;; <em>excelling</em> were the better
word.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In anger Pallas Athen&eacute; made answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Impious one!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to those who would
make themselves higher than the gods must ever come
woe unutterable. Take heed what thou sayest, for
punishment will assuredly be thine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Laughing still, Arachne made reply:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fear not, Athen&eacute;, nor does my heart shake
at the gloomy warning of a foolish old crone.&rdquo; And
turning to the nymphs who, half afraid, listened to
her daring words, she said: &ldquo;Fair nymphs who watch
me day by day, well do ye know that I make no idle
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg&nbsp;85]</a></span>
boast. My skill is as great as that of Athen&eacute;, and greater
still it shall be. Let Athen&eacute; try a contest with me if she
dare! Well do I know who will be the victor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Athen&eacute; cast off her disguise, and before the
frightened nymphs and the bold Arachne stood the
radiant goddess with eyes that blazed with anger and
insulted pride.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lo, Athen&eacute; is come!&rdquo; she said, and nymphs and
women fell on their knees before her, humbly adoring.
Arachne alone was unabashed. Her cheeks showed how
fast her heart was beating. From rosy red to white
went the colour in them, yet, in firm, low voice she
spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have spoken truth,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Not woman,
nor goddess, can do work such as mine. Ready am I to
abide by what I have said, and if I did boast, by my
boast I stand. If thou wilt deign, great goddess, to try
thy skill against the skill of the dyer&rsquo;s daughter and dost
prove the victor, behold me gladly willing to pay the
penalty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The eyes of Athen&eacute;, the grey-eyed goddess, grew dark
as the sea when a thunder-cloud hangs over it and a
mighty storm is coming. Not for one moment did she
delay, but took her place by the side of Arachne. On
the loom they stretched out two webs with a fine warp,
and made them fast on the beam.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;The sley separates the warp, the woof is inserted in the middle
with sharp shuttles, which the fingers hurry along, and, being drawn
within the warp, the teeth notched in the moving sley strike it. Both
hasten on, and girding up their garments to their breasts, they move
their skilful arms, their eagerness beguiling their fatigue. There both
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg&nbsp;86]</a></span>
the purple is being woven, which is subjected to the Tyrian brazen
vessel, and fine shades of minute difference; just as the rainbow, with
its mighty arch, is wont to tint a long tract of sky by means of the
rays reflected by the shower; in which, though a thousand different
colours are shining, yet the very transition eludes the eyes that look
upon it.... There, too, the pliant gold is mixed with the threads.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Ovid.</span></p>

<p>Their canvases wrought, then did Athen&eacute; and Arachne
hasten to cover them with pictures such as no skilled
worker of tapestry has ever since dreamed of accomplishing.
Under the fingers of Athen&eacute; grew up pictures
so real and so perfect that the watchers knew not whether
the goddess was indeed creating life. And each picture
was one that told of the omnipotence of the gods and of
the doom that came upon those mortals who had dared
in their blasphemous presumption to struggle as equals
with the immortal dwellers in Olympus. Arachne glanced
up from her web and looked with eyes that glowed with
the love of beautiful things at the creations of Athen&eacute;.
Yet, undaunted, her fingers still sped on, and the goddess
saw, with brow that grew yet more clouded, how the
daughter of Idmon the dyer had chosen for subjects
the tales that showed the weaknesses of the gods. One
after another the living pictures grew beneath her hand,
and the nymphs held their breath in mingled fear and
ecstasy at Arachne&rsquo;s godlike skill and most arrogant
daring. Between goddess and mortal none could have
chosen, for the colour and form and exquisite fancy of
the pictures of the daughter of Zeus were equalled,
though not excelled, by those of the daughter of the
dyer of Colophon.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg&nbsp;87]</a></span>
Darker and yet more dark grew the eyes of Athen&eacute;
as they looked on the magical beauty of the pictures,
each one of which was an insult to the gods. What
picture had skilful hand ever drawn to compare with
that of Europa who,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;riding on the back of the divine bull, with one hand clasped the
beast&rsquo;s great horn, and with the other caught up her garment&rsquo;s purple
fold, lest it might trail and be drenched in the hoar sea&rsquo;s infinite spray.
And her deep robe was blown out in the wind, like the sail of a ship,
and lightly ever it wafted the maiden onward.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Moschus.</span></p>

<p>Then at last did the storm break, and with her
shuttle the enraged goddess smote the web of Arachne,
and the fair pictures were rent into motley rags and
ribbons. Furiously, too, with her shuttle of boxwood
she smote Arachne. Before her rage, the nymphs
fled back to their golden river and to the vineyards of
Tymolus, and the women of Colophon in blind terror
rushed away. And Arachne, shamed to the dust, knew
that life for her was no longer worth possessing. She
had aspired, in the pride of her splendid genius, to a
contest with a god, and knew now that such a contest
must ever be vain. A cord hung from the weaver&rsquo;s
beam, and swiftly she seized it, knotted it round her
white neck, and would have hanged herself. But ere
the life had passed out of her, Athen&eacute; grasped the cord,
loosened it, and spoke Arachne&rsquo;s doom:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Live!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;O guilty and shameless one!
For evermore shalt thou live and hang as now, thou and
thy descendants, that men may never forget the punishment
of the blasphemous one who dared to rival a god.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg&nbsp;88]</a></span>
Even as she spoke, Arachne&rsquo;s fair form dried up and
withered. Her straight limbs grew grey and crooked
and wiry, and her white arms were no more. And from
the beam where the beautiful weaver of Lydia had been
suspended, there hung from a fine grey thread the
creature from which, to this day, there are but few who
do not turn with loathing. Yet still Arachne spins, and
still is without a compeer.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Not anie damzell, which her vaunteth most<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In skilfull knitting of soft silken twyne,<br /></span>

<p>Thus, perhaps, does Arachne have her compensations,
and in days that followed long after the twilight of the
gods, did she not gain eternal honour in the heart of
every Scot by the tale of how she saved a national hero?
Kindly, too, are her labours for men as she slays their
mortal enemies, the household flies, and when the
peasant&mdash;practical, if not favoured by &AElig;sculapius and
Hygeia&mdash;runs to raid the loom of Arachne in order to
staunch the quick-flowing blood from the cut hand of
her little child, much more dear to her heart is Arachne
the spider than the unknown Athen&eacute;.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Also in spinners be tokens of divination, and of knowing what

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg&nbsp;89]</a></span>
The sun has not long enough shown his face to dry up
the dew in the garden, and behold on the little clipped
tree of boxwood, a great marvel! For in and out, and
all over its twigs and leaves, Arachne has woven her
web, and on the web the dew has dropped a million
diamond drops. And, suddenly, all the colours in the
sky are mirrored dazzlingly on the grey tapestry of her
making. Arachne has come to her own again.</p>

<h2>IDAS AND MARPESSA</h2>


<p>By day, while the sun-god drove his chariot in the high
heavens and turned the blue-green &AElig;gean Sea into the
semblance of a blazing shield of brass, Idas and Marpessa
sat together in the trees&rsquo; soft shades, or walked in
shadowy valleys where violets and wild parsley grew,
and where Apollo rarely deigned to come. At eventide,
when, in royal splendour of purple and crimson and
gold, Apollo sought his rest in the western sky, Idas and
Marpessa wandered by the seashore watching the little
wavelets softly kissing the pebbles on the beach, or
climbed to the mountain side from whence they could
see the first glimpse of Diana&rsquo;s silver crescent and the
twinkling lights of the Pleiades breaking through the
blue canopy of the sky. While Apollo sought in heaven
and on earth the best means to gratify his imperial whims,
Idas, for whom all joys had come to mean but one,
sought ever to be by the side of Marpessa. Shadowy
valley, murmuring sea, lonely mountain side, or garden
where grew the purple amaranth and where roses of pink
and amber-yellow and deepest crimson dropped their
radiant petals on the snowy marble paths, all were the
same to Idas&mdash;Paradise for him, were Marpessa by his
side; without her, dreary desert.</p>

<p>More beautiful than any flower that grew in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg&nbsp;91]</a></span>
garden was Marpessa. No music that Apollo&rsquo;s lute
could make was as sweet in the ears of Idas as her dear
voice. Its music was ever new to him&mdash;a melody to
make his heart more quickly throb. New, too, ever was
her beauty. For him it was always the first time that
they met, always the same fresh ravishment to look in
her eyes. And when to Idas came the knowledge that Marpessa
gave him love for love, he had indeed won happiness
so great as to draw upon him the envy of the gods.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The course of true love never did run smooth,&rdquo;
and, like many and many another father since his day,
Evenos, the father of Marpessa, was bitterly opposed to
a match where the bridegroom was rich only in youth,
in health, and in love. His beautiful daughter naturally
seemed to him worthy of something much more high.
Thus it was an unhappy day for Marpessa when, as she
sat alone by the fountain which dripped slowly down on
the marble basin, and dreamed of her lover, Idas, Apollo
himself, led by caprice, noiselessly walked through the
rose bushes, whose warm petals dropped at his feet as
he passed, and beheld a maiden more fair than the
fairest flower that grew. The hum of bees, the drip,
drip of the fountain, these lulled her mind and heart
and soothed her day-dreams, and Marpessa&rsquo;s red lips,
curved like the bow of Eros, smiled as she thought of
Idas, the man she loved. Silently Apollo watched her.
This queen of all the roses was not fit to be the bride of
mortal man&mdash;Marpessa must be his.</p>

<p>To Evenos Apollo quickly imparted his desire. He
was not used to having his imperial wishes denied, nor
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg&nbsp;92]</a></span>
was Evenos anxious to do so. Here, indeed, was a
match for his daughter. No insignificant mortal, but
the radiant sun-god himself! And to Marpessa he
told what Apollo wished, and Marpessa shyly looked
at her reflection in the pool of the fountain, and wondered
if she were indeed beautiful enough to win the love of
a god.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am I in truth so wondrous fair?&rdquo; she asked her
father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fair enough to mate with Apollo himself!&rdquo;
proudly answered Evenos.</p>

<p>And joyously Marpessa replied, &ldquo;Ah, then am I
happy indeed! I would be beautiful for my Idas&rsquo; sake!&rdquo;</p>

<p>An angry man was her father. There was to be no
more pleasant dallying with Idas in the shadowy wood
or by the seashore. In the rose garden Apollo took his
place and charmed Marpessa&rsquo;s ears with his music,
while her eyes could not but be charmed by his beauty.
The god had no doubts or fears. Only a little time he
would give her, for a very little only would he wait, and
then undoubtedly this mortal maiden would be his, her
heart conquered as assuredly as the rays from his chariot
conquered the roses, whose warm crimson petals they
strewed at his feet. Yet as Marpessa looked and listened,
her thoughts were often far away and always her heart
was with Idas. When Apollo played most exquisitely
to her it seemed that he put her love for Idas into music.
When he spoke to her of his love she thought, &ldquo;Thus,
and thus did Idas speak,&rdquo; and a sudden memory of the
human lad&rsquo;s halting words brought to her heart a little
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg&nbsp;93]</a></span>
gush of tenderness, and made her eyes sparkle so that
Apollo gladly thought, &ldquo;Soon she will be mine.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 278px;">

<img src="images/abom10th.jpg" width="278" height="400"
alt="" /></a>
<span class="caption">MARPESSA SAT ALONE BY THE FOUNTAIN</span>
</div>

<p>And all this while Idas schemed and plotted and
planned a way in which he could save his dear one
from her obdurate father, and from the passion of a god.
He went to Neptune, told his tale, and begged him to
lend him a winged chariot in which he could fly away
with Marpessa. Neptune good-naturedly consented, and
when Idas flew up from the seashore one day, like a
great bird that the tempests have blown inland, Marpessa
joyously sprang up beside her lover, and swiftly
they took flight for a land where in peace they might
live and love together. No sooner did Evenos realise
that his daughter was gone, than, in furious anger
against her and her lover, he gave chase. One has
watched a hawk in pursuit of a pigeon or a bird of the
moors and seen it, a little dark speck at first, gradually
growing larger and more large until at length it dominated
and conquered its prey, swooping down from
above, like an arrow from a bow, to bring with it sudden
death.</p>

<p>So at first it seemed that Evenos must conquer Idas
and Marpessa in the winged chariot of Neptune&rsquo;s lending.
But onwards Idas drove the chariot, ever faster and
faster, until before the eyes of Marpessa the trees of the
forest grew into blurs of blue and brown, and the streams
and rivers as they flew past them were streaks of silver.
Not until he had reached the river Lycormas did the
angry father own that his pursuit had been in vain.
Over the swift-flowing stream flew the chariot driven
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg&nbsp;94]</a></span>
by Idas, but Evenos knew that his horses, flecked with
white foam, pumping each breath from hearts that were
strained to breaking-point, no longer could go on with
the chase. The passage of that deep stream would
destroy them. The fierce water would sweep the wearied
beasts down in its impelling current, and he with them.
A shamed man would he be forever. Not for a moment
did he hesitate, but drew his sharp sword from his belt
and plunged it into the breast of one steed and then of
the other who had been so willing and who yet had
failed him in the end. And then, as they, still in their
traces, neighed shrilly aloud, and then fell over and died
where they lay, Evenos, with a great cry, leaped into the
river. Over his head closed the eddies of the peat-brown
water. Once only did he throw up his arms to ask the
gods for mercy; then did his body drift down with the
stream, and his soul hastened downwards to the Shades.
And from that day the river Lycormas no more was
known by that name, but was called the river <em>Evenos</em>
forever.</p>

<p>Onwards, triumphantly, drove Idas, but soon he
knew that a greater than Evenos had entered in the
chase, and that the jealous sun-god&rsquo;s chariot was in
pursuit of the winged car of Neptune. Quickly it gained
on him&mdash;soon it would have swept down on him&mdash;a
hawk indeed, this time, striking surely its helpless prey&mdash;but
even as Apollo saw the white face of Marpessa and
knew that he was the victor, a mighty thunderbolt that
made the mountains shake, and rolled its echoes through
the lonely fastnesses of a thousand hills, was sent to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg&nbsp;95]</a></span>
earth by Jupiter. While the echoes still re-echoed, there
came from Olympus the voice of Zeus himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Let her decide!</em>&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Apollo, like a white flame blown backward by the
wind, withheld his hands that would have seized from
Idas the woman who was his heart&rsquo;s desire.</p>

<p>And then he spoke, and while his burning gaze was
fixed upon her, and his face, in beautiful fury, was more
perfect than any exquisite picture of her dreams, his
voice was as the voice of the sea as it calls to the shore
in the moonlit hours, as the bird that sings in the darkness
of a tropic night to its longing mate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Marpessa!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;Marpessa! wilt thou not
come to me? No woe nor trouble, never any pain can
touch me. Yet woe indeed was mine when first I saw thy
fairest face. For even now dost thou hasten to sorrow,
to darkness, to the dark-shadowed tomb. Thou art but
mortal! thy beauty is short-lived. Thy love for mortal
man shall quickly fade and die. Come to me, Marpessa,
and my kisses on your lips shall make thee immortal!
Together we shall bring the sunbeams to a cold, dark
land! Together shall we coax the spring flowers from the
still, dead earth! Together we shall bring to men the
golden harvest, and deck the trees of autumn in our liveries
of red and gold. I love thee, Marpessa&mdash;not as mere mortal
loves do I love thee. Come to me, Marpessa&mdash;my Love&mdash;my
Desire!&rdquo;</p>

<p>When his voice was silent, it seemed as if the very
earth itself with all its thousand echoes still breathed his
words: &ldquo;Marpessa&mdash;my Love&mdash;my Desire.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg&nbsp;96]</a></span>
Abashed before the god&rsquo;s entreaties stood Idas. And
the heart of Marpessa was torn as she heard the burning
words of the beautiful Apollo still ringing through her
head, and saw her mortal lover, silent, white-lipped,
gazing first at the god and then into her own pale face.
At length he spoke:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;After such argument what can I plead?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or what pale promise make? Yet since it is<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In woman to pity rather than to aspire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A little I will speak. I love thee then<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of all this world, that cup of brimming June,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That jar of violet wine set in the air,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Nor for that stirring bosom all besieged<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By drowsing lovers, or thy perilous hair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor for that face that might indeed provoke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Invasion of old cities; no, nor all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy freshness stealing on me like strange sleep.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor for this only do I love thee, but<br /></span>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg&nbsp;97]</a></span>
Then Idas, in the humility that comes from perfect
love, drooped low his head, and was silent. In silence
for a minute stood the three&mdash;a god, a man, and a
woman. And from on high the watching stars looked
down and marvelled, and Diana stayed for a moment
the course of her silver car to watch, as she thought, the
triumph of her own invincible brother.</p>

<p>From man to god passed the eyes of Marpessa, and
back from god to man. And the stars forgot to twinkle,
and Diana&rsquo;s silver-maned horses pawed the blue floor of
the sky, impatient at the firm hand of the mistress on the
reins that checked their eager course.</p>

<p>Marpessa spoke at last, in low words that seemed to
come &ldquo;remembered from other worlds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For all the joys he offered her she thanked Apollo.
What grander fate for mortal woman than to rule the
sunbeams&mdash;to bring bliss to the earth and to the sons of
men? What more could mortal woman crave than the
gift of immortality shared with one whose power ruled
the vast universe, and who still had stooped to lay the
red roses of his passionate love at her little, human feet?
And yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;in that sorrow-free existence that
he promised, might there not still be something awanting
to one who had once known tears?</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Yet I, being human, human sorrow miss.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then were he indeed to give her the gift of immortal
life, what value were life to one whose beauty had
withered as the leaves in autumn, whose heart was tired
and dead? What uglier fate than this, to endure an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg&nbsp;98]</a></span>
endless existence in which no life was, yoked to one whose
youth was immortal, whose beauty was everlasting?</p>

<p>Then did she turn to Idas, who stood as one who
awaits the judgment of the judge in whose hands lies the
power of meting out life or death. Thus she spoke:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;But if I live with Idas, then we two<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the low earth shall prosper hand in hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In odours of the open field, and live<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In peaceful noises of the farm, and watch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pastoral fields burned by the setting sun.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he shall give me passionate children, not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some radiant god that will despise me quite,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But clambering limbs and little hearts that err.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">... So shall we live,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And though the first sweet sting of love be past,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sweet that almost venom is; though youth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With tender and extravagant delight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The first and secret kiss by twilight hedge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The insane farewell repeated o&rsquo;er and o&rsquo;er,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pass off; there shall succeed a faithful peace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beautiful friendship tried by sun and wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Durable from the daily dust of life.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>The sun-god frowned as her words fell from her lips.
Even now, as she looked at him, he held out his arms.
Surely she only played with this poor mortal youth.
To him she must come, this rose who could own no lesser
god than the sun-god himself.</p>

<p>But Marpessa spoke on:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;And thou beautiful god, in that far time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When in thy setting sweet thou gazest down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On his grey head, wilt thou remember then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That once I pleased thee, that I once was young?&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>So did her voice cease, and on the earth fell sudden
darkness. For to Apollo had come the shame of love
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg&nbsp;99]</a></span>
rejected, and there were those who said that to the earth
that night there came no sunset, only the sullen darkness
that told of the flight of an angry god. Yet, later, the
silver moonbeams of Diana seemed to greet the dark earth
with a smile, and, in the winged car of Neptune, Idas and
Marpessa sped on, greater than the gods, in a perfect
harmony of human love that feared nor time, nor pain,
nor Death himself.</p>

<h2>ARETHUSA</h2>


<p>&ldquo;We have victualled and watered,&rdquo; wrote Nelson from
Syracuse in 1798, &ldquo;and surely, watering at the fountain
of Arethusa, we must have victory. We shall sail with
the first breeze; and be assured I will return either
crowned with laurel or covered with cypress.&rdquo; Three
days later, he won the Battle of the Nile, one of the
greatest sea-fights of history.</p>

<p>Here in our own land the tales of the Greek gods
seem very remote. Like the colours in an old, old portrait,
the humanity of the stories seems to have faded.
But in Sicily they grow vivid at once. Almost, as we
stand above Syracuse, that long yellow town by the sea&mdash;a
blue-green sea, with deep purple shadows where the
clouds above it grow dark, and little white-sailed boats,
like white butterflies, wing their way across to the far
horizon&mdash;can we</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Have glimpse of Proteus rising from the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or hear old Triton blow his wreath&egrave;d horn.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Here, to this day, one of the myths most impossible
of acceptance to the scientific modern mind lives on,
and Arethusa is not yet forgotten. &ldquo;In Ortygia,&rdquo; says
Cicero, &ldquo;is a fountain of sweet water, the name of which
is Arethusa, of incredible flow, very full of fish, which
would be entirely overwhelmed by the sea, were its
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg&nbsp;101]</a></span>
waters not protected from the waves by a rampart and
a wall of stone.&rdquo; White marble walls have taken the
place of the protecting barrier, but the spring bubbles up
to this day, and Ortygia (Quail Island) is the name still
given to that part of Syracuse. Fluffy-headed, long,
green stalks of papyrus grow in the fountain, and red and
golden fish dart through its clear water. Beyond lie
the low shores of Plemmgrium, the fens of Lysimeleia,
the hills above the Anapus, and above all towers Etna,
in snowy and magnificent serenity and indifference
to the changes wrought by the centuries to gods and to
men. Yet here the present is completely overshadowed
by the past, and even the story of Arethusa knocks loudly
at the well-barricaded doors of twentieth-century incredulity.</p>

<p>The beautiful Arethusa was a nymph in Diana&rsquo;s train,
and many a time in the chase did she thread her way
through the dim woodland, as a stream flows down
through the forest from the mountains to the sea. But
to her, at last, there came a day when she was no longer
the huntress but the hunted.</p>

<p>The flaming wheels of the chariot of Apollo had made
the whole land scintillate with heat, and the nymph
sought the kind shelter of a wood where she might bathe
in the exquisite coolness of the river that still was chilled
by the snows of the mountain. On the branch of a tree
that bent over the stream she hung her garments, and
joyously stepped into the limpid water. A ray of the
sun glanced through the leaves above her and made the
soft sand in the river&rsquo;s bed gleam like gold and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg&nbsp;102]</a></span>
beautiful limbs of the nymph seem as though carved from
pure white marble by the hand of Pygmalion himself.
There was no sound there but the gentle sound of the
stream that murmured caressingly to her as it slowly
moved on through the solitude, and so gently it flowed
that almost it seemed to stand still, as though regretful
to leave for the unknown forest so beautiful a thing as
Arethusa.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;The Earth seemed to love her<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Heaven smiled above her.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>But suddenly the stillness of the stream was ruffled.
Waves, like the newly-born brothers of the billows of
the sea, swept both down-stream and up-stream upon
her, and the river no longer murmured gently, but spoke
to her in a voice that thrilled with passionate longing.
Alpheus, god of the river, had beheld her, and, beholding
her, had loved her once and forever. An uncouth
creature of the forest was he, unversed in all the arts of
love-making. So not as a supplicant did he come to her,
but as one who demanded fiercely love for love. Terror
came upon Arethusa as she listened, and hastily she
sprang from the water that had brought fear upon her,
and hastened to find shelter in the woodlands. Then
the murmur, as of the murmur of a river before a mighty
flood comes to seize it and hold it for its own, took form
in a voice that pled with her, in tones that made her
tremble as she heard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hear me, Arethusa!&rdquo; it said. &ldquo;I am Alpheus, god
of the river that now thou hast made sacred. I am the
god of the rushing streams&mdash;the god of the thundering
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg&nbsp;103]</a></span>
cataracts. Where the mountain streams crash over the
rocks and echo through the shadowy hollows of the hills,
I hold my kingship. Down from Etna I come, and the
fire of Etna is in my veins. I love thee! I love but
thee, and thou shalt be mine, and I thine forever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Arethusa, in blind panic, fled before the god
who loved her. Through the shadowy forest she sped,
while he swiftly gained upon her. The asphodel bent
under her flying feet, and the golden flowers of the <i>Fiori
Maggio</i> were swept aside as she fled. Yet ever Alpheus
gained upon her, until at length she felt that the chase
was ended, and cried to Diana to save her. Then a
cloud, grey and thick and blinding as the mist that
wraps the mountain tops, suddenly descended and
enfolded her, and Alpheus groped for her in vain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Arethusa!&rdquo; she heard him cry, in a voice of
piteous longing&mdash;&ldquo;Arethusa!&mdash;my belov&egrave;d!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Patiently he waited, with the love that makes uncouth
things beautiful, until at length a little breath
from Zephyrus blew aside the soft grey veil that hid his
beloved from his sight, and he saw that the nymph had
been transformed into a fountain. Not for a moment
did Alpheus delay, but, turning himself into a torrent
in flood, he rushed on in pursuit of Arethusa. Then did
Diana, to save her votary, cleave a way for her through
the dark earth even into the gloomy realm of Pluto
himself, and the nymph rushed onward, onward still,
and then upward, until at length she emerged again to
the freedom of the blue sky and green trees, and beheld
the golden orange groves and the grey olives, the burning
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg&nbsp;104]</a></span>
red geranium flowers and the great snow-capped
mountain of Sicily.</p>

<p>But Alpheus had a love for her that cast out all
fear. Through the terrible blackness of the Cocytus
valley he followed Arethusa, and found a means of
bursting through the encumbering earth and joining her
again. And in a spring that rises out of the sea near
the shore he was able at last to mingle his waters with
those of the one for whom he had lost his godship.</p>

<h2>PERSEUS THE HERO</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;We call such a man a hero in English to this day, and call it a
&lsquo;heroic&rsquo; thing to suffer pain and grief, that we may do good to our
fellow-men.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Charles Kingsley.</span></p>


<p>In the pleasant land of Argos, now a place of unwholesome
marshes, once upon a time there reigned a king
called Acrisius, the father of one fair daughter. Dana&euml;
was her name, and she was very dear to the king until a
day when he longed to know what lay hid for him in the
lap of the gods, and consulted an oracle. With hanging
head he returned from the temple, for the oracle had told
him that when his daughter Dana&euml; had borne a son, by
the hand of that son death must surely come upon him.
And because the fear of death was in him more strong
than the love of his daughter, Acrisius resolved that by
sacrificing her he would baffle the gods and frustrate
Death itself. A great tower of brass was speedily built
at his command, and in this prison Dana&euml; was placed,
to drag out her weary days.</p>

<p>But who can escape the designs of the gods? From
Olympus great Zeus himself looked down and saw the
air princess sighing away her youth. And, full of pity
and of love, he himself entered the brazen tower in a
golden shower, and Dana&euml; became the bride of Zeus and
happily passed with him the time of her imprisonment.</p>

<p>To her at length was born a son, a beautiful and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg&nbsp;106]</a></span>
kingly child, and great was the wrath of her father when
he had tidings of the birth. Did the gods in the high
heavens laugh at him? The laugh should yet be on his
side. Down to the seashore he hurried Dana&euml; and her
newly-born babe, the little Perseus, put them in a great
chest, and set them adrift to be a plaything for winds and
waves and a prey for the cruel and hungry sea.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;When in the cunningly-wrought chest the raging blast and the
stirred billow and terror fell upon her, with tearful cheeks she cast her
arm around Perseus and spake, &lsquo;Alas, my child, what sorrow is mine!
But thou slumberest, in baby-wise sleeping in this woeful ark; midst the
darkness of the brazen rivet thou shinest and in the swart gloom sent
forth; thou heedest not the deep foam of the passing wave above thy
locks nor the voice of the blast as thou liest in thy purple covering, a
sweet face. If terror had terrors for thee, and thou wert giving ear to
my gentle words&mdash;I bid thee sleep, my babe, and may the sea sleep and
our measureless woe; and may change of fortune come forth, Father
Zeus, from thee. For that I make my prayer in boldness and beyond
right, forgive me.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p></div>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Simonides of Keos.</span></p>

<p>For days and nights the mother and child were
tossed on the billows, but yet no harm came near them,
and one morning the chest grounded on the rocky beach
of Seriphos, an island in the &AElig;gean Sea. Here a fisherman
came on this strange flotsam and jetsam of the
waves and took the mother and child to Polydectes, the
king, and the years that followed were peaceful years
for Dana&euml; and for Perseus. But as Perseus grew up,
growing each day more goodly to look upon, more fearless,
more ready to gaze with serene courage into the
eyes of gods and of men, an evil thing befell his mother.
She was but a girl when he was born, and as the years
passed she grew ever more fair. And the crafty eyes of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg&nbsp;107]</a></span>
old Polydectes, the king, ever watched her more eagerly,
always more hotly desired her for his wife. But Dana&euml;,
the beloved of Zeus himself, had no wish to wed the old
king of the Cyclades, and proudly she scorned his suit.
Behind her, as she knew well, was the stout arm of her
son Perseus, and while Perseus was there, the king could
do her no harm. But Perseus, unwitting of the danger
his mother daily had to face, sailed the seas unfearingly,
and felt that peace and safety surrounded him on every
side. At Samos one day, while his ship was lading,
Perseus lay down under the shade of a great tree, and
soon his eyelids grew heavy with sleep, and there came
to him, like butterflies that flit over the flowers in a sunlit
garden, pleasant, light-winged dreams. But yet another
dream followed close on the merry heels of those that
went before. And before Perseus there stood one whose
grey eyes were as the fathomless sea on the dawn of a
summer day. Her long robes were blue as the hyacinths
in spring, and the spear that she held in her hand was of
a polished brightness, as the dart with which the gods
smite the heart of a man, with joy inexpressible, with
sorrow that is scarcely to be borne. To Perseus she
spoke winged words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Pallas Athen&eacute;,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and to me the
souls of men are known. Those whose fat hearts are as
those of the beasts that perish do I know. They live at
ease. No bitter sorrow is theirs, nor any fierce joy that
lifts their feet free from the cumbering clay. But dear
to my heart are the souls of those whose tears are tears
of blood, whose joy is as the joy of the Immortals. Pain
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg&nbsp;108]</a></span>
is theirs, and sorrow. Disappointment is theirs, and
grief. Yet their love is as the love of those who dwell on
Olympus. Patient they are and long-suffering, and
ever they hope, ever do they trust. Ever they fight,
fearless and unashamed, and when the sum of their days
on earth is accomplished, wings, of whose existence they
have never had knowledge, bear them upwards, out of
the mist and din and strife of life, to the life that has no
ending.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then she laid her hand on the hand of Perseus.
&ldquo;Perseus,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;art thou of those whose dull souls
forever dwell in pleasant ease, or wouldst thou be as one
of the Immortals?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And in his dream Perseus answered without hesitation:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rather let me die, a youth, living my life to the
full, fighting ever, suffering ever,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;than live
at ease like a beast that feeds on flowery pastures and
knows no fiery gladness, no heart-bleeding pain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Pallas Athen&eacute;, laughing for joy, because she
loved so well a hero&rsquo;s soul, showed him a picture that
made even his brave heart sick for dread, and told him
a terrible story.</p>

<p>In the dim, cold, far west, she said, there lived three
sisters. One of them, Medusa, had been one of her
priestesses, golden-haired and most beautiful, but when
Athen&eacute; found that she was as wicked as she was lovely,
swiftly had she meted out a punishment. Every lock
of her golden hair had been changed into a venomous
snake. Her eyes, that had once been the cradles of love,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg&nbsp;109]</a></span>
were turned into love&rsquo;s stony tombs. Her rosy cheeks
were now of Death&rsquo;s own livid hue. Her smile, which
drew the hearts of lovers from their bosoms, had become
a hideous thing. A grinning mask looked on the
world, and to the world her gaping mouth and protruding
tongue meant a horror before which the world
stood terrified, dumb. There are some sadnesses too
terrible for human hearts to bear, so it came to pass
that in the dark cavern in which she dwelt, and in the
shadowy woods around it, all living things that had met
the awful gaze of her hopeless eyes were turned into
stone. Then Pallas Athen&eacute; showed Perseus, mirrored
in a brazen shield, the face of one of the tragic things of
the world. And as Perseus looked, his soul grew chill
within him. But when Athen&eacute;, in low voice, asked
him:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perseus, wilt even end the sorrow of this piteous
sinful one?&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;Even that will I do&mdash;the
gods helping me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Pallas Athen&eacute;, smiling again in glad content,
left him to dream, and Perseus awoke, in sudden fear,
and found that in truth he had but dreamed, yet held
his dream as a holy thing in the secret treasure-house of
his heart.</p>

<p>Back to Seriphos he sailed, and found that his mother
walked in fear of Polydectes the king. She told her
son&mdash;a strong man now, though young in years&mdash;the
story of his cruel persecution. Perseus saw red blood,
and gladly would he have driven his keen blade
far home in the heart of Polydectes. But his vengeance
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg&nbsp;110]</a></span>
was to be a great vengeance, and the vengeance was
delayed.</p>

<p>The king gave a feast, and on that day every one in
the land brought offerings of their best and most costly
to do him honour. Perseus alone came empty-handed,
and as he stood in the king&rsquo;s court as though he were a
beggar, the other youths mocked at him of whom they
had ever been jealous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thou sayest that thy father is one of the gods!&rdquo;
they said. &ldquo;Where is thy godlike gift, O Perseus!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Polydectes, glad to humble the lad who was
keeper of his mother&rsquo;s honour, echoed their foolish
taunt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is the gift of the gods that the noble son of
the gods has brought me?&rdquo; he asked, and his fat
cheeks and loose mouth quivered with ugly merriment.</p>

<p>Then Perseus, his head thrown back, gazed in the
bold eyes of Polydectes.</p>

<p>Son of Zeus he was indeed, as he looked with royal
scorn at those whom he despised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A godlike gift thou shalt have, in truth, O king,&rdquo; he
said, and his voice rang out as a trumpet-call before the
battle. &ldquo;The gift of the gods shall be thine. The gods
helping me, thou shalt have the head of Medusa.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A laugh, half-born, died in the throats of Polydectes
and of those who listened, and Perseus strode out of the
palace, a glow in his heart, for he knew that Pallas
Athen&eacute; had lit the fire that burned in him now, and that
though he should shed the last drop of his life&rsquo;s blood
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg&nbsp;111]</a></span>
to win what he sought, right would triumph, and wrong
must be worsted.</p>

<p>Still quivering with anger, Perseus went down to the
blue sea that gently whispered its secrets to the shore on
which he stood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If Pallas Athen&eacute; would but come,&rdquo; he thought&mdash;&ldquo;if
only my dreams might come true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For, like many a boy before and since, Perseus had
dreamed of gallant, fearless deeds. Like many a boy
before and since, he had been the hero of a great adventure.</p>

<p>So he prayed, &ldquo;Come to me! I pray you, Pallas
Athen&eacute;, come! and let me dream true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His prayer was answered.</p>

<p>Into the sky there came a little silver cloud that grew
and grew, and ever it grew nearer, and then, as in his
dream, Pallas Athen&eacute; came to him and smiled on him as
the sun smiles on the water in spring. Nor was she
alone. Beside her stood Hermes of the winged shoes,
and Perseus knelt before the two in worship. Then, very
gently, Pallas Athen&eacute; gave him counsel, and more than
counsel she gave.</p>

<p>In his hand she placed a polished shield, than which
no mirror shone more brightly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not look at Medusa herself; look only on her
image here reflected&mdash;then strike home hard and swiftly.
And when her head is severed, wrap it in the goatskin
on which the shield hangs. So wilt thou return in safety
and in honour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how, then, shall I cross the wet grey fields of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg&nbsp;112]</a></span>
this watery way?&rdquo; asked Perseus. &ldquo;Would that I
were a white-winged bird that skims across the waves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, with the smile of a loving comrade, Hermes laid
his hand on the shoulder of Perseus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My winged shoes shall be thine,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and the
white-winged sea-birds shalt thou leave far, far behind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet another gift is thine,&rdquo; said Athen&eacute;. &ldquo;Gird
on, as gift from the gods, this sword that is immortal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment Perseus lingered. &ldquo;May I not bid
farewell to my mother?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;May I not offer
burnt-offerings to thee and to Hermes, and to my father
Zeus himself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Athen&eacute; said Nay, at his mother&rsquo;s weeping his
heart might relent, and the offering that the Olympians
desired was the head of Medusa.</p>

<p>Then, like a fearless young golden eagle, Perseus
spread out his arms, and the winged shoes carried him
across the seas to the cold northern lands whither
Athen&eacute; had directed him.</p>

<p>Each day his shoes took him a seven days&rsquo; journey,
and ever the air through which he passed grew more
chill, till at length he reached the land of everlasting
snow, where the black ice never knows the conquering
warmth of spring, and where the white surf of the moaning
waves freezes solid even as it touches the shore.</p>

<p>It was a dark grim place to which he came, and in a
gloomy cavern by the sea lived the Grae&aelig;, the three grey
sisters that Athen&eacute; had told him he must seek. Old and
grey and horrible they were, with but one tooth amongst
them, and but one eye. From hand to hand they passed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg&nbsp;113]</a></span>
the eye, and muttered and shivered in the blackness and
the cold.</p>

<span class="caption">THEY WHIMPERED AND BEGGED OF HIM</span>
</div>

<p>Boldly Perseus spoke to them and asked them to
guide him to the place where Medusa and her sisters
the Gorgons dwelt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No others know where they dwell,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Tell
me, I pray thee, the way that I may find them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the Grey Women were kin to the Gorgons, and
hated all the children of men, and ugly was their evil
mirth as they mocked at Perseus and refused to tell him
where Medusa might be found.</p>

<p>But Perseus grew wily in his desire not to fail, and
as the eye passed from one withered, clutching hand to
another, he held out his own strong young palm, and in
her blindness one of the three placed the eye within it.</p>

<p>Then the Grey Women gave a piteous cry, fierce and
angry as the cry of old grey wolves that have been robbed
of their prey, and gnashed upon him with their toothless
jaws.</p>

<p>And Perseus said: &ldquo;Wicked ye are and cruel at
heart, and blind shall ye remain forever unless ye tell
me where I may find the Gorgons. But tell me that, and
I give back the eye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then they whimpered and begged of him, and when
they found that all their beseeching was in vain, at
length they told him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go south,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;so far south that at length
thou comest to the uttermost limits of the sea, to the
place where the day and night meet. There is the
Garden of the Hesperides, and of them must thou ask
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg&nbsp;114]</a></span>
the way.&rdquo; And &ldquo;Give us back our eye!&rdquo; they wailed
again most piteously, and Perseus gave back the eye
into a greedy trembling old hand, and flew south like a
swallow that is glad to leave the gloomy frozen lands
behind.</p>

<p>To the garden of the Hesperides he came at last, and
amongst the myrtles and roses and sunny fountains he
came on the nymphs who there guard the golden fruit,
and begged them to tell him whither he must wing his
way in order to find the Gorgons. But the nymphs
could not tell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must ask Atlas,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;the giant who sits
high up on the mountain and with his strong shoulders
keeps the heavens and earth apart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And with the nymphs Perseus went up the mountain
and asked the patient giant to guide him to the place of
his quest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Far away I can see them,&rdquo; said Atlas, &ldquo;on an
island in the great ocean. But unless thou wert to wear
the helmet of Pluto himself, thy going must be in vain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is this helmet?&rdquo; asked Perseus, &ldquo;and how
can I gain it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didst thou wear the helmet of the ruler of Dark
Places, thou wouldst be as invisible as a shadow in the
blackness of night,&rdquo; answered Atlas; &ldquo;but no mortal
can obtain it, for only the Immortals can brave the
terrors of the Shadowy Land and yet return; yet if thou
wilt promise me one thing, the helmet shall be thine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What wouldst thou?&rdquo; asked Perseus.</p>

<p>And Atlas said, &ldquo;For many a long year have I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg&nbsp;115]</a></span>
borne this earth, and I grow aweary of my burden.
When thou hast slain Medusa, let me gaze upon her
face, that I may be turned into stone and suffer no
more forever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Perseus promised, and at the bidding of Atlas
one of the nymphs sped down to the land of the Shades,
and for seven days Perseus and her sisters awaited her
return. Her face was as the face of a white lily and her
eyes were dark with sadness when she came, but with
her she bore the helmet of Pluto, and when she and her
sisters had kissed Perseus and bidden him a sorrowful
farewell, he put on the helmet and vanished away.</p>

<p>Soon the gentle light of day had gone, and he found
himself in a place where clammy fog blotted out all
things, and where the sea was black as the water of that
stream that runs through the Cocytus valley. And in
that silent land where there is &ldquo;neither night nor day,
nor cloud nor breeze nor storm,&rdquo; he found the cave of
horrors in which the Gorgons dwelt.</p>

<p>Two of them, like monstrous swine, lay asleep,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;But a third woman paced about the hall,<br /></span>

<p>In the shield of Pallas Athen&eacute; the picture was mirrored,
and as Perseus gazed on it his soul grew heavy for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg&nbsp;116]</a></span>
the beauty and the horror of Medusa. And &ldquo;Oh that it
had been her foul sisters that I must slay!&rdquo; he thought
at first, but then&mdash;&ldquo;To slay her will be kind indeed,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;Her beauty has become corruption, and all the
joy of life for her has passed into the agony of remembrance,
the torture of unending remorse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And when he saw her brazen claws that still were
greedy and lustful to strike and to slay, his face grew
stern, and he paused no longer, but with his sword he
smote her neck with all his might and main. And to
the rocky floor the body of Medusa fell with brazen
clang, but her head he wrapped in the goatskin, while
he turned his eyes away. Aloft then he sprang, and
flew swifter than an arrow from the bow of Diana.</p>

<p>With hideous outcry the two other Gorgons found
the body of Medusa, and, like foul vultures that hunt a
little song-bird, they flew in pursuit of Perseus. For
many a league they kept up the chase, and their howling
was grim to hear. Across the seas they flew, and over
the yellow sand of the Libyan desert, and as Perseus
flew before them, some blood-drops fell from the severed
head of Medusa, and from them bred the vipers that are
found in the desert to this day. But bravely did the
winged shoes of Hermes bear Perseus on, and by nightfall
the Gorgon sisters had passed from sight, and Perseus
found himself once more in the garden of the Hesperides.
Ere he sought the nymphs, he knelt by the sea to cleanse
from his hands Medusa&rsquo;s blood, and still does the seaweed
that we find on sea-beaches after a storm bear the
crimson stains.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg&nbsp;117]</a></span>
And when Perseus had received glad welcome from
the fair dwellers in the garden of the Hesperides, he
sought Atlas, that to him he might fulfil his promise;
and eagerly Atlas beheld him, for he was aweary of his
long toil.</p>

<p>So Perseus uncovered the face of Medusa and held it
up for the Titan to gaze upon.</p>

<p>And when Atlas looked upon her whose beauty had
once been pure and living as that of a flower in spring,
and saw only anguish and cruelty, foul wickedness, and
hideous despair, his heart grew like stone within him.
To stone, too, turned his great, patient face, and into
stone grew his vast limbs and strong, crouching back.
So did Atlas the Titan become Atlas the Mountain, and
still his head, white-crowned with snow, and his great
shoulder far up in misty clouds, would seem to hold
apart the earth and the sky.</p>

<p>Then Perseus again took flight, and in his flight he
passed over many lands and suffered weariness and
want, and sometimes felt his faith growing low. Yet
ever he sped on, hoping ever, enduring ever. In Egypt
he had rest and was fed and honoured by the people of
the land, who were fain to keep him to be one of their
gods. And in a place called Chemmis they built a
statue of him when he had gone, and for many hundreds
of years it stood there. And the Egyptians said that
ever and again Perseus returned, and that when he came
the Nile rose high and the season was fruitful because
he had blessed their land.</p>

<p>Far down below him as he flew one day he saw
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg&nbsp;118]</a></span>
something white on a purple rock in the sea. It seemed
too large to be a snowy-plumaged bird, and he darted
swiftly downward that he might see more clearly. The
spray lashed against the steep rocks of the desolate
island, and showered itself upon a figure that at first he
took to be a statue of white marble. The figure was but
that of a girl, slight and very youthful, yet more fair
even than any of the nymphs of the Hesperides. Invisible
in his Helmet of Darkness, Perseus drew near,
and saw that the fragile white figure was shaken by
shivering sobs. The waves, every few moments, lapped
up on her little cold white feet, and he saw that heavy
chains held her imprisoned to that chilly rock in the
sea. A great anger stirred the heart of Perseus, and
swiftly he took the helmet from his head and stood
beside her. The maid gave a cry of terror, but there
was no evil thing in the face of Perseus. Naught but
strength and kindness and purity shone out of his
steady eyes.</p>

<p>Thus when, very gently, he asked her what was the
meaning of her cruel imprisonment, she told him the
piteous story, as a little child tells the story of its grief
to the mother who comforts it. Her mother was queen
of Ethiopia, she said, and very, very beautiful. But
when the queen had boasted that no nymph who played
amongst the snow-crested billows of the sea was as fair
as she, a terrible punishment was sent to her. All along
the coast of her father&rsquo;s kingdom a loathsome sea-monster
came to hold its sway, and hideous were its
ravages. Men and women, children and animals, all
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg&nbsp;119]</a></span>
were equally desirable food for its insatiate maw, and
the whole land of Ethiopia lay in mourning because of
it. At last her father, the king, had consulted an oracle
that he might find help to rid the land of the monster.
And the oracle had told him that only when his fair
daughter, Andromeda, had been sacrificed to the creature
that scourged the sea-coast would the country go free.
Thus had she been brought there by her parents that
one life might be given for many, and that her mother&rsquo;s
broken heart might expiate her sin of vanity. Even
as Andromeda spoke, the sea was broken by the track
of a creature that cleft the water as does the forerunning
gale of a mighty storm. And Andromeda gave
a piteous cry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lo! he comes!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Save me! ah,
save me! I am so young to die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Perseus darted high above her and for an
instant hung poised like a hawk that is about to strike.
Then, like the hawk that cannot miss its prey, swiftly
did he swoop down and smote with his sword the devouring
monster of the ocean. Not once, but again and
again he smote, until all the water round the rock was
churned into slime and blood-stained froth, and until
his loathsome combatant floated on its back, mere
carrion for the scavengers of the sea.</p>

<p>Then Perseus hewed off the chains that held Andromeda,
and in his arms he held her tenderly as he flew
with her to her father&rsquo;s land.</p>

<p>Who so grateful then as the king and queen of
Ethiopia? and who so happy as Andromeda? for Perseus,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg&nbsp;120]</a></span>
her deliverer, dearest and greatest hero to her in all the
world, not only had given her her freedom, but had
given her his heart.</p>

<p>Willingly and joyfully her father agreed to give her
to Perseus for his wife. No marriage feast so splendid
had ever been held in Ethiopia in the memory of man,
but as it went on, an angry man with a band of sullen-faced
followers strode into the banqueting-hall. It was
Phineus, he who had been betrothed to Andromeda, yet
who had not dared to strike a blow for her rescue.
Straight at Perseus they rushed, and fierce was the fight
that then began. But of a sudden, from the goatskin
where it lay hid, Perseus drew forth the head of Medusa,
and Phineus and his warriors were turned into stone.</p>

<p>For seven days the marriage feast lasted, but on the
eighth night Pallas Athen&eacute; came to Perseus in a dream.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nobly and well hast thou played the hero, O son of
Zeus!&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;but now that thy toil is near an end
and thy sorrows have ended in joy, I come to claim the
shoes of Hermes, the helmet of Pluto, the sword, and the
shield that is mine own. Yet the head of the Gorgon
must thou yet guard awhile, for I would have it laid in
my temple at Seriphos that I may wear it on my shield
for evermore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As she ceased to speak, Perseus awoke, and lo, the
shield and helmet and the sword and winged shoes were
gone, so that he knew that his dream was no false vision.</p>

<p>Then did Perseus and Andromeda, in a red-prowed
galley made by cunning craftsmen from Ph&oelig;nicia, sail
away westward, until at length they came to the blue
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg&nbsp;121]</a></span>
water of the &AElig;gean Sea, and saw rising out of the waves
before them the rocks of Seriphos. And when the
rowers rested on their long oars, and the red-prowed
ship ground on the pebbles of the beach, Perseus and his
bride sought Dana&euml;, the fair mother of Perseus.</p>

<p>Black grew the brow of the son of Dana&euml; when she
told him what cruel things she had suffered in his absence
from the hands of Polydectes the king. Straight to the
palace Perseus strode, and there found the king and his
friends at their revels. For seven years had Perseus
been away, and now it was no longer a stripling who stood
in the palace hall, but a man in stature and bearing like
one of the gods. Polydectes alone knew him, and from
his wine he looked up with mocking gaze.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So thou hast returned? oh nameless son of a deathless
god,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Thou didst boast, but methinks
thy boast was an empty one!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But even as he spoke, the jeering smile froze on his
face, and the faces of those who sat with him stiffened
in horror.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O king,&rdquo; Perseus said, &ldquo;I swore that, the gods helping
me, thou shouldst have the head of Medusa. The
gods have helped me. Behold the Gorgon&rsquo;s head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wild horror in their eyes, Polydectes and his friends
gazed on the unspeakable thing, and as they gazed they
turned into stone&mdash;a ring of grey stones that still sit on
a hillside of Seriphos.</p>

<p>With his wife and his mother, Perseus then sailed
away, for he had a great longing to take Dana&euml; back to
the land of her birth and to see if her father, Acrisius,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg&nbsp;122]</a></span>
still lived and might not now repent of his cruelty to her
and to his grandson. But there he found that the sins
of Acrisius had been punished and that he had been
driven from his throne and his own land by a usurper.
Not for long did the sword of Perseus dwell in its scabbard,
and speedily was the usurper cast forth, and all the
men of Argos acclaimed Perseus as their glorious king.
But Perseus would not be their king.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I go to seek Acrisius,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My mother&rsquo;s
father is your king.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again his galley sailed away, and at last, up the long
Eub&oelig;an Sea they came to the town of Larissa, where
the old king now dwelt.</p>

<p>A feast and sports were going on when they got there,
and beside the king of the land sat Acrisius, an aged
man, yet a kingly one indeed.</p>

<p>And Perseus thought, &ldquo;If I, a stranger, take part in
the sports and carry away prizes from the men of Larissa,
surely the heart of Acrisius must soften towards me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus did he take off his helmet and cuirass, and
stood unclothed beside the youths of Larissa, and so
godlike was he that they all said, amazed, &ldquo;Surely this
stranger comes from Olympus and is one of the Immortals.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In his hand he took a discus, and full five fathoms
beyond those of the others he cast it, and a great shout
arose from those who watched, and Acrisius cried out as
loudly as all the rest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Further still!&rdquo; they cried. &ldquo;Further still canst
thou hurl! thou art a hero indeed!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg&nbsp;123]</a></span>
And Perseus, putting forth all his strength, hurled once
again, and the discus flew from his hand like a bolt from
the hand of Zeus. The watchers held their breath and
made ready for a shout of delight as they saw it speed
on, further than mortal man had ever hurled before.
But joy died in their hearts when a gust of wind caught
the discus as it sped and hurled it against Acrisius,
the king. And with a sigh like the sigh that passes
through the leaves of a tree as the woodman fells it and
it crashes to the earth, so did Acrisius fall and lie prone.
To his side rushed Perseus, and lifted him tenderly in
his arms. But the spirit of Acrisius had fled. And with
a great cry of sorrow Perseus called to the people:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Behold me! I am Perseus, grandson of the man I
have slain! Who can avoid the decree of the gods?&rdquo;</p>

<p>For many a year thereafter Perseus reigned as king,
and to him and to his fair wife were born four sons and
three daughters. Wisely and well he reigned, and
when, at a good old age, Death took him and the wife
of his heart, the gods, who had always held him dear,
took him up among the stars to live for ever and ever.
And there still, on clear and starry nights, we may see
him holding the Gorgon&rsquo;s head. Near him are the father
and mother of Andromeda&mdash;Cepheus and Cassiopeia,
and close beside him stands Andromeda with her white
arms spread out across the blue sky as in the days when
she stood chained to the rock. And those who sail the
watery ways look up for guidance to one whose voyaging
is done and whose warfare is accomplished, and take
their bearings from the constellation of Cassiopeia.</p>

<h2>NIOBE</h2>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;... Like Niobe, all tears.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Shakespeare.</span></p>


<p>The quotation is an overworked quotation, like many
another of those from <i>Hamlet</i>; yet, have half of those
whose lips utter it more than the vaguest acquaintance
with the story of Niobe and the cause of her tears? The
noble group&mdash;attributed to Praxiteles&mdash;of Niobe and her
last remaining child, in the Uffizi Palace at Florence, has
been so often reproduced that it also has helped to
make the anguished figure of the Theban queen a
familiar one in pictorial tragedy, so that as long as the
works of those Titans of art, Shakespeare and Praxiteles,
endure, no other monument is wanted for the memory
of Niobe.</p>

<p>Like many of the tales of mythology, her tragedy is
a story of vengeance wreaked upon a mortal by an
angry god. She was the daughter of Tantalus, and her
husband was Amphion, King of Thebes, himself a son of
Zeus. To her were born seven fair daughters and seven
beautiful and gallant sons, and it was not because of her
own beauty, nor her husband&rsquo;s fame, nor their proud
descent and the greatness of their kingdom, that the
Queen of Thebes was arrogant in her pride. Very sure
she was that no woman had ever borne children like her
own children, whose peers were not to be found on earth
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg&nbsp;125]</a></span>
nor in heaven. Even in our own day there are mortal
mothers who feel as Niobe felt.</p>

<p>But amongst the Immortals there was also a mother
with children whom she counted as peerless. Latona,
mother of Apollo and Diana, was magnificently certain
that in all time, nor in eternity to come, could there be
a son and daughter so perfect in beauty, in wisdom, and
in power as the two that were her own. Loudly did she
proclaim her proud belief, and when Niobe heard it she
laughed in scorn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The goddess has a son and a daughter,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Beautiful and wise and powerful they may be, but I
have borne seven daughters and seven sons, and each
son is more than the peer of Apollo, each daughter more
than the equal of Diana, the moon-goddess!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And to her boastful words Latona gave ear, and
anger began to grow in her heart.</p>

<p>Each year the people of Thebes were wont to hold a
great festival in honour of Latona and her son and
daughter, and it was an evil day for Niobe when she
came upon the adoring crowd that, laurel-crowned, bore
frankincense to lay before the altars of the gods whose
glories they had assembled together to celebrate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh foolish ones!&rdquo; she said, and her voice was
full of scorn, &ldquo;am I not greater than Latona? I am
the daughter of a goddess, my husband, the king, the
son of a god. Am I not fair? am I not queenly as
Latona herself? And, of a surety, I am richer by far
than the goddess who has but one daughter and one son.
Look on my seven noble sons! behold the beauty of my
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg&nbsp;126]</a></span>
seven daughters, and see if they in beauty and all else
do not equal the dwellers in Olympus!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And when the people looked, and shouted aloud,
for in truth Niobe and her children were like unto gods,
their queen said, &ldquo;Do not waste thy worship, my
people. Rather make the prayers to thy king and to
me and to my children who buttress us round and make
our strength so great, that fearlessly we can despise
the gods.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In her home on the Cynthian mountain top, Latona
heard the arrogant words of the queen of Thebes, and
even as a gust of wind blows smouldering ashes into
a consuming fire, her growing anger flamed into rage.
She called Apollo and Diana to her, and commanded
them to avenge the blasphemous insult which had been
given to them and to their mother. And the twin gods
listened with burning hearts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Truly shalt thou be avenged!&rdquo; cried Apollo.
&ldquo;The shameless one shall learn that not unscathed goes
she who profanes the honour of the mother of the deathless
gods!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And with their silver bows in their hands, Apollo,
the smiter from afar, and Diana, the virgin huntress,
hasted to Thebes. There they found all the noble
youths of the kingdom pursuing their sports. Some
rode, some were having chariot-races, and excelling in
all things were the seven sons of Niobe.</p>

<p>Apollo lost no time. A shaft from his quiver flew,
as flies a bolt from the hand of Zeus, and the first-born
of Niobe fell, like a young pine broken by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg&nbsp;127]</a></span>
the wind, on the floor of his winning chariot. His
brother, who followed him, went on the heels of his
comrade swiftly down to the Shades. Two of the other
sons of Niobe were wrestling together, their great muscles
moving under the skin of white satin that covered their
perfect bodies, and as they gripped each other, yet
another shaft was driven from the bow of Apollo, and
both lads fell, joined by one arrow, on the earth, and
there breathed their lives away.</p>

<p>Their elder brother ran to their aid, and to him,
too, came death, swift and sure. The two youngest,
even as they cried for mercy to an unknown god, were
hurried after them by the unerring arrows of Apollo.
The cries of those who watched this terrible slaying
were not long in bringing Niobe to the place where
her sons lay dead. Yet, even then, her pride was unconquered,
and she defied the gods, and Latona, to
whose jealousy she ascribed the fate of her &ldquo;seven
spears.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not yet hast thou conquered, Latona!&rdquo; she cried.
&ldquo;My seven sons lie dead, yet to me still remain the
seven perfect lovelinesses that I have borne. Try to
match them, if thou canst, with the beauty of thy two!
Still am I richer than thou, O cruel and envious mother
of one daughter and one son!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But even as she spoke, Diana had drawn her bow,
and as the scythe of a mower quickly cuts down, one
after the other, the tall white blossoms in the meadow,
so did her arrows slay the daughters of Niobe. When
one only remained, the pride of Niobe was broken.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg&nbsp;128]</a></span>
With her arms round the little slender frame of her
golden-haired youngest born, she looked up to heaven,
and cried upon all the gods for mercy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is so little!&rdquo; she wailed. &ldquo;So young&mdash;so
dear! Ah, spare me <em>one</em>,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;only one out of
so many!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the gods laughed. Like a harsh note of music
sounded the twang of Diana&rsquo;s bow. Pierced by a
silver arrow, the little girl lay dead. The dignity of
Latona was avenged.</p>

<p>Overwhelmed by despair, King Amphion killed himself,
and Niobe was left alone to gaze on the ruin
around her. For nine days she sat, a Greek Rachel,
weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted,
because they were not. On the tenth day, the sight
was too much even for the superhuman hearts of the
gods to endure. They turned the bodies into stone and
themselves buried them. And when they looked on the
face of Niobe and saw on it a bleeding anguish that no
human hand could stay nor the word of any god
comfort, the gods were merciful. Her grief was immortalised,
for Niobe, at their will, became a stone, and
was carried by a wailing tempest to the summit of
Mount Sipylus, in Lydia, where a spring of Argos bore
her name. Yet although a rock was Niobe, from her
blind eyes of stone the tears still flowed, a clear stream
of running water, symbol of a mother&rsquo;s anguish and
never-ending grief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whom the gods love die young&rdquo;&mdash;truly it would
seem so, as we read the old tales of men and of women
beloved of the gods. To those men who were deemed
worthy of being companions of the gods, seemingly no
good fortune came. Yet, after all, if even in a brief
span of life they had tasted god-given happiness, was
their fate one to be pitied? Rather let us keep our
tears for those who, in a colourless grey world, have seen
the dull days go past laden with trifling duties, unnecessary
cares and ever-narrowing ideals, and have
reached old age and the grave&mdash;no narrower than their
lives&mdash;without ever having known a fulness of happiness,
such as the Olympians knew, or ever having dared
to reach upwards and to hold fellowship with the
Immortals.</p>

<p>Hyacinthus was a Spartan youth, son of Clio, one
of the Muses, and of the mortal with whom she
had mated, and from mother, or father, or from the
gods themselves, he had received the gift of beauty.
It chanced one day that as Apollo drove his chariot on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg&nbsp;130]</a></span>
its all-conquering round, he saw the boy. Hyacinthus
was as fair to look upon as the fairest of women, yet he
was not only full of grace, but was muscular, and strong
as a straight young pine on Mount Olympus that fears
not the blind rage of the North Wind nor the angry
tempests of the South.</p>

<p>When Apollo had spoken with him he found that
the face of Hyacinthus did not belie the heart within
him, and gladly the god felt that at last he had found
the perfect companion, the ever courageous and joyous
young mate, whose mood was always ready to meet
his own. Did Apollo desire to hunt, with merry shout
Hyacinthus called the hounds. Did the great god
deign to fish, Hyacinthus was ready to fetch the nets
and to throw himself, whole-souled, into the great affair
of chasing and of landing the silvery fishes. When
Apollo wished to climb the mountains, to heights so
lonely that not even the moving of an eagle&rsquo;s wing
broke the everlasting stillness, Hyacinthus&mdash;his strong
limbs too perfect for the chisel of any sculptor worthily
to reproduce&mdash;was ready and eager for the climb. And
when, on the mountain top, Apollo gazed in silence over
illimitable space, and watched the silver car of his
sister Diana rising slowly into the deep blue of the
sky, silvering land and water as she passed, it was
never Hyacinthus who was the first to speak&mdash;with
words to break the spell of Nature&rsquo;s perfect beauty,
shared in perfect companionship. There were times,
too, when Apollo would play his lyre, and when naught
but the music of his own making could fulfil his longing.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg&nbsp;131]</a></span>
And when those times came, Hyacinthus would lie at
the feet of his friend&mdash;of the friend who was a god&mdash;and
would listen, with eyes of rapturous joy, to the
music that his master made. A very perfect friend was
this friend of the sun-god.</p>

<p>Nor was it Apollo alone who desired the friendship
of Hyacinthus. Zephyrus, god of the South
Wind, had known him before Apollo crossed his path
and had eagerly desired him for a friend. But who
could stand against Apollo? Sulkily Zephyrus marked
their ever-ripening friendship, and in his heart jealousy
grew into hatred, and hatred whispered to him of
revenge. Hyacinthus excelled at all sports, and when
he played quoits it was sheer joy for Apollo, who
loved all things beautiful, to watch him as he stood
to throw the disc, his taut muscles making him look
like Hermes, ready to spurn the cumbering earth from
off his feet. Further even than the god, his friend,
could Hyacinthus throw, and always his merry laugh
when he succeeded made the god feel that nor man nor
god could ever grow old. And so there came that day,
fore-ordained by the Fates, when Apollo and Hyacinthus
played a match together. Hyacinthus made a
valiant throw, and Apollo took his place, and cast the
discus high and far. Hyacinthus ran forward eager to
measure the distance, shouting with excitement over a
throw that had indeed been worthy of a god. Thus did
Zephyrus gain his opportunity. Swiftly through the
tree-tops ran the murmuring South Wind, and smote
the discus of Apollo with a cruel hand. Against the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg&nbsp;132]</a></span>
forehead of Hyacinthus it dashed, smiting the locks that
lay upon it, crashing through skin and flesh and bone,
felling him to the earth. Apollo ran towards him and
raised him in his arms. But the head of Hyacinthus fell
over on the god&rsquo;s shoulder, like the head of a lily whose
stem is broken. The red blood gushed to the ground,
an unquenchable stream, and darkness fell on the eyes
of Hyacinthus, and, with the flow of his life&rsquo;s blood,
his gallant young soul passed away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would that I could die for thee, Hyacinthus!&rdquo;
cried the god, his god&rsquo;s heart near breaking. &ldquo;I have
robbed thee of thy youth. Thine is the suffering, mine
the crime. I shall sing thee ever&mdash;oh perfect friend!
And evermore shalt thou live as a flower that will speak
to the hearts of men of spring, of everlasting youth&mdash;of
life that lives forever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he spoke, there sprang from the blood-drops at
his feet a cluster of flowers, blue as the sky in spring,
yet hanging their heads as if in sorrow.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<span class="caption">DARKNESS FELL ON THE EYES OF HYACINTHUS</span>
</div>

<p>And still, when winter is ended, and the song of
birds tell us of the promise of spring, if we go to the
woods, we find traces of the vow of the sun-god. The
trees are budding in buds of rosy hue, the willow branches
are decked with silvery catkins powdered with gold.
The larches, like slender dryads, wear a feathery garb of
tender green, and under the trees of the woods the
primroses look up, like fallen stars. Along the woodland
path we go, treading on fragrant pine-needles and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg&nbsp;133]</a></span>
on the beech leaves of last year that have not yet lost
their radiant amber. And, at a turn of the way, the
sun-god suddenly shines through the great dark branches
of the giants of the forest, and before us lies a patch of
exquisite blue, as though a god had robbed the sky
and torn from it a precious fragment that seems alive
and moving, between the sun and the shadow.</p>

<p>And, as we look, the sun caresses it, and the South
Wind gently moves the little bell-shaped flowers of the
wild hyacinth as it softly sweeps across them. So does
Hyacinthus live on; so do Apollo and Zephyrus still
love and mourn their friend.</p>

<h2>KING MIDAS OF THE GOLDEN TOUCH</h2>


<p>In the plays of Shakespeare we have three distinct
divisions&mdash;three separate volumes. One deals with Tragedy,
another with Comedy, a third with History; and
a mistake made by the young in their aspect of
life is that they do the same thing, and keep tragedy
and comedy severely apart, relegating them to separate
volumes that, so they think, have nothing to do with
each other. But those who have passed many milestones
on the road know that &ldquo;<em>History</em>&rdquo; is the only
right label for the Book of Life&rsquo;s many parts, and
that the actors in the great play are in truth tragic
comedians.</p>

<p>This is the story of Midas, one of the chief tragic
comedians of mythology.</p>

<p>Once upon a time the kingdom of Phrygia lacked a
king, and in much perplexity, the people sought help
from an oracle. The answer was very definite:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The first man who enters your city riding in a
car shall be your king.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That day there came slowly jogging into the city in
their heavy, wooden-wheeled wain, the peasant Gordias
and his wife and son, whose destination was the marketplace,
and whose business was to sell the produce of their
little farm and vineyard&mdash;fowls, a goat or two, and a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg&nbsp;135]</a></span>
couple of skinsful of strong, purple-red wine. An eager
crowd awaited their entry, and a loud shout of welcome
greeted them. And their eyes grew round and their
mouths fell open in amaze when they were hailed as
King and Queen and Prince of Phrygia.</p>

<p>The gods had indeed bestowed upon Gordias, the low-born
peasant, a surprising gift, but he showed his gratitude
by dedicating his wagon to the deity of the oracle and
tying it up in its place with the wiliest knot that his
simple wisdom knew, pulled as tight as his brawny arms
and strong rough hands could pull. Nor could anyone
untie the famous Gordian knot, and therefore become,
as the oracle promised, lord of all Asia, until centuries
had passed, and Alexander the Great came to Phrygia and
sliced through the knot with his all-conquering sword.</p>

<p>In time Midas, the son of Gordias, came to inherit
the throne and crown of Phrygia. Like many another
not born and bred to the purple, his honours sat heavily
upon him. From the day that his father&rsquo;s wain had
entered the city amidst the acclamations of the people,
he had learned the value of power, and therefore, from
his boyhood onward, power, always more power, was
what he coveted. Also his peasant father had taught
him that gold could buy power, and so Midas ever
longed for more gold, that could buy him a place in the
world that no descendant of a long race of kings should
be able to contest. And from Olympus the gods looked
down and smiled, and vowed that Midas should have
the chance of realising his heart&rsquo;s desire.</p>

<p>Therefore one day when he and his court were sitting
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg&nbsp;136]</a></span>
in the solemn state that Midas required, there rode
into their midst, tipsily swaying on the back of a gentle
full-fed old grey ass, ivy-crowned, jovial and foolish,
the satyr Silenus, guardian of the young god Bacchus.</p>

<p>With all the deference due to the friend of a god
Midas treated this disreputable old pedagogue, and for
ten days and nights on end he feasted him royally. On
the eleventh day Bacchus came in search of his preceptor,
and in deep gratitude bade Midas demand of him
what he would, because he had done Silenus honour
when to dishonour him lay in his power.</p>

<p>Not even for a moment did Midas ponder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would have gold,&rdquo; he said hastily&mdash;&ldquo;much gold.
I would have that touch by which all common and
valueless things become golden treasures.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Bacchus, knowing that here spoke the son of
peasants who many times had gone empty to bed after
a day of toilful striving on the rocky uplands of Phrygia,
looked a little sadly in the eager face of Midas, and
answered: &ldquo;Be it as thou wilt. Thine shall be the
golden touch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Bacchus and Silenus went away, a rout of
singing revellers at their heels, and Midas quickly put
to proof the words of Bacchus.</p>

<p>An olive tree grew near where he stood, and from it
he picked a little twig decked with leaves of softest grey,
and lo, it grew heavy as he held it, and glittered like a
piece of his crown. He stooped to touch the green turf
on which some fragrant violets grew, and turf grew into
cloth of gold, and violets lost their fragrance and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg&nbsp;137]</a></span>
became hard, solid, golden things. He touched an
apple whose cheek grew rosy in the sun, and at once it
became like the golden fruit in the Garden of the Hesperides.
The stone pillars of his palace as he brushed
past them on entering, blazed like a sunset sky. The
gods had not deceived him. Midas had the Golden
Touch. Joyously he strode into the palace and commanded
a feast to be prepared&mdash;a feast worthy of an
occasion so magnificent.</p>

<p>But when Midas, with the healthy appetite of the
peasant-born, would have eaten largely of the savoury
food that his cooks prepared, he found that his teeth
only touched roast kid to turn it into a slab of gold,
that garlic lost its flavour and became gritty as he
chewed, that rice turned into golden grains, and curdled
milk became a dower fit for a princess, entirely unnegotiable
for the digestion of man. Baffled and miserable,
Midas seized his cup of wine, but the red wine had
become one with the golden vessel that held it; nor could
he quench his thirst, for even the limpid water from the
fountain was melted gold when it touched his dry lips.
Only for a very few days was Midas able to bear the
affliction of his wealth. There was nothing now for
him to live for. He could buy the whole earth if he
pleased, but even children shrank in terror from his
touch, and hungry and thirsty and sick at heart he
wearily dragged along his weighty robes of gold. Gold
was power, he knew well, yet of what worth was gold
while he starved? Gold could not buy him life and
health and happiness.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg&nbsp;138]</a></span>
In despair, at length he cried to the god who had
given him the gift that he hated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Save me, O Bacchus!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;A witless one
am I, and the folly of my desire has been my undoing.
Take away from me the accursed Golden Touch, and
faithfully and well shall I serve thee forever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Bacchus, very pitiful for him, told Midas to go to
Sardis, the chief city of his worshippers, and to trace to its
source the river upon which it was built. And in that
pool, when he found it, he was to plunge his head, and so
he would, for evermore, be freed from the Golden Touch.</p>

<p>It was a long journey that Midas then took, and a
weary and a starving man was he when at length he
reached the spring where the river Pactolus had its
source. He crawled forward, and timidly plunged in his
head and shoulders. Almost he expected to feel the
harsh grit of golden water, but instead there was the joy
he had known as a peasant boy when he laved his face
and drank at a cool spring when his day&rsquo;s toil was ended.
And when he raised his face from the pool, he knew that
his hateful power had passed from him, but under the
water he saw grains of gold glittering in the sand, and from
that time forth the river Pactolus was noted for its gold.</p>

<p>One lesson the peasant king had learnt by paying in
suffering for a mistake, but there was yet more suffering
in store for the tragic comedian.</p>

<p>He had now no wish for golden riches, nor even for
power. He wished to lead the simple life and to listen
to the pipings of Pan along with the goat-herds on the
mountains or the wild creatures in the woods. Thus
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg&nbsp;139]</a></span>
it befell that he was present one day at a contest between
Pan and Apollo himself. It was a day of merry-making
for nymphs and fauns and dryads, and all those who
lived in the lonely solitudes of Phrygia came to listen to
the music of the god who ruled them. For as Pan sat
in the shade of a forest one night and piped on his reeds
until the very shadows danced, and the water of the
stream by which he sat leapt high over the mossy stones
it passed, and laughed aloud in its glee, the god had so
gloried in his own power that he cried:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who speaks of Apollo and his lyre? Some of the
gods may be well pleased with his music, and mayhap
a bloodless man or two. But my music strikes to the
heart of the earth itself. It stirs with rapture the very
sap of the trees, and awakes to life and joy the innermost
soul of all things mortal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Apollo heard his boast, and heard it angrily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, thou whose soul is the soul of the untilled
ground!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;wouldst thou place thy music, that
is like the wind in the reeds, beside my music, which is
as the music of the spheres?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Pan, splashing with his goat&rsquo;s feet amongst the
water-lilies of the stream on the bank of which he sat,
laughed loudly and cried:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yea, would I, Apollo! Willingly would I play thee
a match&mdash;thou on thy golden lyre&mdash;I on my reeds from
the river.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus did it come to pass that Apollo and Pan
matched against each other their music, and King Midas
was one of the judges.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg&nbsp;140]</a></span>
First of all Pan took his fragile reeds, and as he
played, the leaves on the trees shivered, and the sleeping
lilies raised their heads, and the birds ceased their song
to listen and then flew straight to their mates. And all
the beauty of the world grew more beautiful, and all
its terror grew yet more grim, and still Pan piped
on, and laughed to see the nymphs and the fauns first
dance in joyousness and then tremble in fear, and the
buds to blossom, and the stags to bellow in their lordship
of the hills. When he ceased, it was as though
a tensely-drawn string had broken, and all the earth
lay breathless and mute. And Pan turned proudly
to the golden-haired god who had listened as he had
spoken through the hearts of reeds to the hearts of
men.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Canst, then, make music like unto my music,
Apollo?&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Then Apollo, his purple robes barely hiding the
perfection of his limbs, a wreath of laurel crowning his
yellow curls, looked down at Pan from his godlike
height and smiled in silence. For a moment his hand
silently played over the golden strings of his lyre, and
then his finger-tips gently touched them. And every
creature there who had a soul, felt that that soul had
wings, and the wings sped them straight to Olympus.
Far away from all earth-bound creatures they flew,
and dwelt in magnificent serenity amongst the Immortals.
No longer was there strife, or any dispeace. No
more was there fierce warring between the actual and
the unknown. The green fields and thick woods had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg&nbsp;141]</a></span>
faded into nothingness, and their creatures, and the
fair nymphs and dryads, and the wild fauns and centaurs
longed and fought no more, and man had ceased to
desire the impossible. Throbbing nature and passionately
desiring life faded into dust before the melody
that Apollo called forth, and when his strings had
ceased to quiver and only the faintly remembered echo
of his music remained, it was as though the earth had
passed away and all things had become new.</p>

<p>For the space of many seconds all was silence.</p>

<p>Then, in low voice, Apollo asked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye who listen&mdash;who is the victor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And earth and sea and sky, and all the creatures of
earth and sky, and of the deep, replied as one:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The victory is thine, Divine Apollo.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yet was there one dissentient voice.</p>

<p>Midas, sorely puzzled, utterly un-understanding, was
relieved when the music of Apollo ceased. &ldquo;If only
Pan would play again,&rdquo; he murmured to himself. &ldquo;I
wish to live, and Pan&rsquo;s music gives me life. I love the
woolly vine-buds and the fragrant pine-leaves, and the
scent of the violets in the spring. The smell of the fresh-ploughed
earth is dear to me, the breath of the kine
that have grazed in the meadows of wild parsley and of
asphodel. I want to drink red wine and to eat and
love and fight and work and be joyous and sad, fierce and
strong, and very weary, and to sleep the dead sleep of
men who live only as weak mortals do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Therefore he raised his voice, and called very loud:
&ldquo;Pan&rsquo;s music is sweeter and truer and greater than the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg&nbsp;142]</a></span>
music of Apollo. Pan is the victor, and I, King Midas,
give him the victor&rsquo;s crown!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With scorn ineffable the sun-god turned upon Midas,
his peasant&rsquo;s face transfigured by his proud decision.
For a little he gazed at him in silence, and his look
might have turned a sunbeam to an icicle.</p>

<p>Then he spoke:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The ears of an ass have heard my music,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Henceforth shall Midas have ass&rsquo;s ears.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And when Midas, in terror, clapped his hands to his
crisp black hair, he found growing far beyond it, the
long, pointed ears of an ass. Perhaps what hurt him
most, as he fled away, was the shout of merriment that
came from Pan. And fauns and nymphs and satyrs
echoed that shout most joyously.</p>

<p>Willingly would he have hidden in the woods, but
there he found no hiding-place. The trees and shrubs
and flowering things seemed to shake in cruel mockery.
Back to his court he went and sent for the court hairdresser,
that he might bribe him to devise a covering
for these long, peaked, hairy symbols of his folly.
Gladly the hairdresser accepted many and many oboli,
many and many golden gifts, and all Phrygia wondered,
while it copied, the strange headdress of the king.</p>

<p>But although much gold had bought his silence, the
court barber was unquiet of heart. All day and all
through the night he was tormented by his weighty
secret. And then, at length, silence was to him a
torture too great to be borne; he sought a lonely place,
there dug a deep hole, and, kneeling by it, softly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg&nbsp;143]</a></span>
whispered to the damp earth: &ldquo;King Midas has ass&rsquo;s
ears.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Greatly relieved, he hastened home, and was well
content until, on the spot where his secret lay buried,
rushes grew up. And when the winds blew through
them, the rushes whispered for all those who passed
by to hear: &ldquo;King Midas has ass&rsquo;s ears! King Midas
has ass&rsquo;s ears!&rdquo; Those who listen very carefully to
what the green rushes in marshy places whisper as the
wind passes through them, may hear the same thing to
this day. And those who hear the whisper of the rushes
may, perhaps, give a pitying thought to Midas&mdash;the
tragic comedian of mythology.</p>

<h2>CEYX AND HALCYONE</h2>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;St. Martin&rsquo;s summer, halcyon days.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="author"><i>King Henry VI</i>, i. 2, 131.</p>


<p>&ldquo;Halcyon days&rdquo;&mdash;how often is the expression made
use of, how seldom do its users realise from whence
they have borrowed it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These were halcyon days,&rdquo; says the old man, and
his memory wanders back to a time when for him</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">&ldquo;All the world is young, lad,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the trees are green;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And every goose a swan, lad,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And every lass a queen.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Yet the story of Halcyone is one best to be understood
by the heavy-hearted woman who wanders along the
bleak sea-beach and strains her weary eyes for the brown
sail of the fishing-boat that will never more return.</p>

<p>Over the kingdom of Thessaly, in the days of long
ago, there reigned a king whose name was Ceyx, son of
Hesperus, the Day Star, and almost as radiant in grace
and beauty as was his father. His wife was the fair
Halcyone, daughter of &AElig;olus, ruler of the winds, and
most perfectly did this king and queen love one another.
Their happiness was unmarred until there came a day
when Ceyx had to mourn for the loss of a brother.
Following close on the heels of this disaster came direful
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg&nbsp;145]</a></span>
prodigies which led Ceyx to fear that in some way he
must have incurred the hostility of the gods. To him
there was no way in which to discover wherein lay his
fault, and to make atonement for it, but by going to
consult the oracle of Apollo at Claros, in Ionia. When
he told Halcyone what he must do, she knew well that
she must not try to turn him from his solemn purpose,
yet there hung over her heart a black shadow of fear
and of evil foreboding that no loving words of assurance
could drive away. Most piteously she begged him
to take her with him, but the king knew too well the
dangers of the treacherous &AElig;gean Sea to risk on it the
life of the woman that he loved so well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I promise,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;by the rays of my Father
the Day Star, that if fate permits I will return before the
moon shall have twice rounded her orb.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Down by the shore the sailors of King Ceyx awaited
his coming, and when with passionately tender love he
and Halcyone had taken farewell of each other, the
rowers sat down on the benches and dipped their long
oars into the water.</p>

<p>With rhythmic swing they drove the great ship over
the grey sea, while Ceyx stood on deck and gazed back at
his wife until his eyes could no longer distinguish her
from the rocks on the shore, nor could she any longer
see the white sails of the ship as it crested the restless
waves. Heavier still was her heart when she turned
away from the shore, and yet more heavy it grew as the
day wore on and dark night descended. For the air was
full of the clamorous wailings of the fierce winds whose
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg&nbsp;146]</a></span>
joy it is to lash the waves into rage and to strew with
dead men and broken timber the angry, surf-beaten shore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My King,&rdquo; she sighed to herself. &ldquo;My King! my
Own!&rdquo; And through the weary hours she prayed to
the gods to bring him safely back to her, and many
times she offered fragrant incense to Juno, protectress of
women, that she might have pity on a woman whose
husband and true lover was out in the storm, a plaything
for ruthless winds and waves.</p>

<p>A helpless plaything was the king of Thessaly. Long
ere the dim evening light had made of the shore of
his own land a faint, grey line, the white-maned horses
of Poseidon, king of the seas, began to rear their
heads, and as night fell, a black curtain, blotting out
every landmark, and all home-like things, the East
Wind rushed across the &AElig;gean Sea, smiting the sea-horses
into madness, seizing the sails with cruel grasp
and casting them in tatters before it, snapping the
mast as though it were but a dry reed by the river.
Before so mighty a tempest no oars could be of any
avail, and for a little time only the winds and waves
gambolled like a half-sated wolf-pack over their helpless
prey. With hungry roar the great weight of black
water stove in the deck and swept the sailors out of the
ship to choke them in its icy depths; and ever it would
lift the wounded thing high up on its foaming white
crests, as though to toss it to the dark sky, and ever
again would suck it down into the blackness, while the
shrieking winds drove it onward with howling taunts
and mocking laughter. While life stayed in him, Ceyx
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg&nbsp;147]</a></span>
thought only of Halcyone. He had no fear, only the fear
of the grief his death must bring to her who loved him
as he loved her, his peerless queen, his Halcyone. His
prayers to the gods were prayers for her. For himself
he asked one thing only&mdash;that the waves might bear
his body to her sight, so that her gentle hands might lay
him in his tomb. With shout of triumph that they
had slain a king, winds and waves seized him even as
he prayed, and the Day Star that was hidden behind
the black pall of the sky knew that his son, a brave king
and a faithful lover, had gone down to the Shades.</p>

<p>When Dawn, the rosy-fingered, had come to Thessaly,
Halcyone, white-faced and tired-eyed, anxiously watched
the sea, that still was tossing in half-savage mood.
Eagerly she gazed at the place where last the white sail
had been seen. Was it not possible that Ceyx, having
weathered the gale, might for the present have foregone
his voyage to Ionia, and was returning to her to bring
peace to her heart? But the sea-beach was strewn with
wrack and the winds still blew bits of tattered surf along
the shore, and for her there was only the heavy labour
of waiting, of waiting and of watching for the ship that
never came. The incense from her altars blew out, in
heavy sweetness, to meet the bitter-sweet tang of the
seaweed that was carried in by the tide, for Halcyone
prayed on, fearful, yet hoping that her prayers might
still keep safe her man&mdash;her king&mdash;her lover. She busied
herself in laying out the garments he would wear on his
return, and in choosing the clothes in which she might
be fairest in his eyes. This robe, as blue as the sky in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg&nbsp;148]</a></span>
spring&mdash;silver-bordered, as the sea in kind mood is
bordered with a feathery silver fringe. She could recall
just how Ceyx looked when first he saw her wear it.
She could hear his very tones as he told her that of all
queens she was the peeress, of all women the most
beautiful, of all wives the most dear. Almost she forgot
the horrors of the night, so certain did it seem that his
dear voice must soon again tell her the words that have
been love&rsquo;s litany since ever time began.</p>

<p>In the ears of Juno those petitions for him whose
dead body was even then being tossed hither and
thither by the restless waves, his murderers, came at
last to be more than even she could bear. She gave
command to her handmaiden Iris to go to the palace
of Somnus, god of Sleep and brother of Death, and to
bid him send to Halcyone a vision, in the form of Ceyx,
to tell her that all her weary waiting was in vain.</p>

<p>In a valley among the black Cimmerian mountains
the death-god Somnus had his abode. In her rainbow-hued
robes, Iris darted through the sky at her mistress&rsquo;s
bidding, tingeing, as she sped through them, the clouds
that she passed. It was a silent valley that she reached
at last. Here the sun never came, nor was there ever
any sound to break the silence. From the ground the
noiseless grey clouds, whose work it is to hide the sun
and moon, rose softly and rolled away up to the mountain
tops and down to the lowest valleys, to work the
will of the gods. All around the cave lurked the long
dark shadows that bring fear to the heart of children,
and that, at nightfall, hasten the steps of the timid
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg&nbsp;149]</a></span>
wayfarer. No noise was there, but from far down the
valley there came a murmur so faint and so infinitely
soothing that it was less a sound than of a lullaby
remembered in dreams. For past the valley of Sleep
flow the waters of Lethe, the river of Forgetfulness.
Close up to the door of the cave where dwelt the twin
brothers, Sleep and Death, blood-red poppies grew, and
at the door itself stood shadowy forms, their fingers on
their lips, enjoining silence on all those who would enter
in, amaranth-crowned, and softly waving sheaves of
poppies that bring dreams from which there is no
awakening. There was there no gate with hinges to
creak or bars to clang, and into the stilly darkness Iris
walked unhindered. From outer cave to inner cave she
went, and each cave she left behind was less dark than
the one that she entered. In the innermost room of all,
on an ebony couch draped with sable curtains, the god
of sleep lay drowsing. His garments were black, strewn
with golden stars. A wreath of half-opened poppies
crowned his sleepy head, and he leaned on the strong
shoulder of Morpheus, his favourite son. All round his
bed hovered pleasant dreams, gently stooping over him
to whisper their messages, like a field of wheat swayed
by the breeze, or willows that bow their silver heads and
murmur to each other the secrets that no one ever knows.
Brushing the idle dreams aside, as a ray of sunshine brushes
away the grey wisps of mist that hang to the hillside,
Iris walked up to the couch where Somnus lay. The
light from her rainbow-hued robe lit up the darkness of
the cave, yet Somnus lazily only half-opened his eyes,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg&nbsp;150]</a></span>
moved his head so that it rested more easily, and in a
sleepy voice asked of her what might be her errand.
&ldquo;Somnus,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;gentlest of gods, tranquilliser of
minds and soother of careworn hearts, Juno sends you
her commands that you despatch a dream to Halcyone
in the city of Trachine, representing her lost husband
and all the events of the wreck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her message delivered, Iris hastened away, for it
seemed to her that already her eyelids grew heavy, and
that there were creeping upon her limbs, throwing silver
dust in her eyes, lulling into peaceful slumber her mind,
those sprites born of the blood-red poppies that bring
to weary mortals rest and sweet forgetfulness.</p>

<p>Only rousing himself sufficiently to give his orders,
Somnus entrusted to Morpheus the task imposed upon
him by Juno, and then, with a yawn, turned over on his
downy pillow, and gave himself up to exquisite slumber.</p>

<p>When he had winged his way to Trachine, Morpheus
took upon himself the form of Ceyx and sought the room
where Halcyone slept. She had watched the far horizon
many hours that day. For many an hour had she
vainly burned incense to the gods. Tired in heart and
soul, in body and in mind, she laid herself down on
her couch at last, hoping for the gift of sleep. Not
long had she slept, in the dead-still sleep that weariness
and a stricken heart bring with them, when Morpheus
came and stood by her side. He was only a dream,
yet his face was the face of Ceyx. Not the radiant,
beautiful son of the Day Star was the Ceyx who stood
by her now and gazed on her with piteous, pitying dead
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg&nbsp;151]</a></span>
eyes. His clothing dripped sea-water; in his hair was
tangled the weed of the sea, uprooted by the storm.
Pale, pale was his face, and his white hands gripped the
stones and sand that had failed him in his dying agony.</p>

<p>Halcyone whimpered in her sleep as she looked on
him, and Morpheus stooped over her and spoke the
words that he had been told to say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am thy husband, Ceyx, Halcyone. No more do
prayers and the blue-curling smoke of incense avail me.
Dead am I, slain by the storm and the waves. On my
dead, white face the skies look down and the restless sea
tosses my chill body that still seeks thee, seeking a haven
in thy dear arms, seeking rest on thy warm, loving heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a cry Halcyone started up, but Morpheus had
fled, and there were no wet footprints nor drops of sea-water
on the floor, marking, as she had hoped, the way
that her lord had taken. Not again did Sleep visit her
that night.</p>

<p>A grey, cold morning dawned and found her on the
seashore. As ever, her eyes sought the far horizon,
but no white sail, a messenger of hope, was there to
greet her. Yet surely she saw something&mdash;a black
speck, like a ship driven on by the long oars of mariners
who knew well the path to home through the watery
ways. From far away in the grey it hasted towards
her, and then there came to Halcyone the knowledge
that no ship was this thing, but a lifeless body, swept
onwards by the hurrying waves. Nearer and nearer it
came, until at length she could recognise the form of this
flotsam and jetsam of the sea. With heart that broke
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg&nbsp;152]</a></span>
as she uttered the words, she stretched out her arms and
cried aloud: &ldquo;O Ceyx! my Beloved! is it thus that
thou returnest to me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>To break the fierce assaults of sea and of storm there
had been built out from the shore a mole, and on to this
barrier leapt the distraught Halcyone. She ran along
it, and when the dead, white body of the man she loved
was still out of reach, she prayed her last prayer&mdash;a
wordless prayer of anguish to the gods.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only let me get near him,&rdquo; she breathed. &ldquo;Grant
only that I nestle close against his dear breast. Let me
show him that, living or dead, I am his, and he mine
forever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And to Halcyone a great miracle was then vouchsafed,
for from out of her snowy shoulders grew snow-white
pinions, and with them she skimmed over the
waves until she reached the rigid body of Ceyx, drifting,
a helpless burden for the conquering waves, in with the
swift-flowing tide. As she flew, she uttered cries of
love and of longing, but only strange raucous cries came
from the throat that had once only made music. And
when she reached the body of Ceyx and would fain have
kissed his marble lips, Halcyone found that no longer
were her own lips like the petals of a fair red rose
warmed by the sun. For the gods had heard her prayer,
and her horny beak seemed to the watchers on the shore
to be fiercely tearing at the face of him who had been
king of Thessaly.</p>

<span class="caption">A GREY COLD MORNING FOUND HER ON THE SEASHORE</span>
</div>

<p>Yet the gods were not merciless&mdash;or, perhaps, the
love of Halcyone was an all-conquering love. For as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg&nbsp;153]</a></span>
the soul of Halcyone had passed into the body of a
white-winged sea-bird, so also passed the soul of her
husband the king. And for evermore Halcyone and
her mate, known as the Halcyon birds, defied the storm
and tempest, and proudly breasted, side by side, the
angriest waves of the raging seas.</p>

<p>To them, too, did the gods grant a boon: that, for
seven days before the shortest day of the year, and for
seven days after it, there should reign over the sea a
great calm in which Halcyone, in her floating nest,
should hatch her young. And to those days of calm
and sunshine, the name of the Halcyon Days was given.</p>

<p>And still, as a storm approaches, the white-winged
birds come flying inland with shrill cries of warning to
the mariners whose ships they pass in their flight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ceyx!&rdquo; they cry. &ldquo;Remember Ceyx!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And hastily the fishermen fill their sails, and the
smacks drive homeward to the haven where the blue
smoke curls upwards from the chimneys of their homesteads,
and where the red poppies are nodding sleepily
amongst the yellow corn.</p>

<h2>ARIST&AElig;US THE BEE-KEEPER</h2>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;... Every sound is sweet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Myriads of rivers hurrying thro&rsquo; the lawn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The moan of doves in immemorial elms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And murmuring of innumerable bees.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Tennyson.</span></p>


<p>In the fragrance of the blossom of the limes the bees
are gleaning a luscious harvest. Their busy humming
sounds like the surf on a reef heard from very far away,
and would almost lull to sleep those who lazily, drowsily
spend the sunny summer afternoon in the shadow of
the trees. That line of bee-hives by the sweet-pea hedge
shows where they store their treasure that men may
rob them of it, but out on the uplands where the heather
is purple, the wild bees hum in and out of the honey-laden
bells and carry home their spoils to their own
free fastnesses, from which none can drive them unless
there comes a foray against them from the brown men
of the moors.</p>

<p>How many of us who watch their ardent labours
know the story of Arist&aelig;us&mdash;he who first brought the
art of bee-keeping to perfection in his own dear land of
Greece, and whose followers are those men in veils of
blue and green, that motley throng who beat fire-irons
and create a hideous clamour in order that the queen
bee and her excited followers may be checked in their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg&nbsp;155]</a></span>
perilous voyagings and beguiled to swarm in the sanctuary
of a hive.</p>

<p>Arist&aelig;us was a shepherd, the son of Cyrene, a water
nymph, and to him there had come one day, as he listened
to the wild bees humming amongst the wild thyme, the
great thought that he might conquer these busy workers
and make their toil his gain. He knew that hollow trees
or a hole in a rock were used as the storage houses of
their treasure, and so the wily shepherd lad provided
for them the homes he knew that they would covet, and
near them placed all the food that they most desired.
Soon Arist&aelig;us became noted as a tamer of bees, and even
in Olympus they spoke of his honey as a thing that was
food for the gods. All might have gone well with Arist&aelig;us
had there not come for him the fateful day when
he saw the beautiful Eurydice and to her lost his heart.
She fled before the fiery protestations of his love, and
trod upon the serpent whose bite brought her down to
the Shades. The gods were angry with Arist&aelig;us, and
as punishment they slew his bees. His hives stood
empty and silent, and no more did &ldquo;the murmuring of
innumerable bees&rdquo; drowse the ears of the herds who
watched their flocks cropping the red clover and the
asphodel of the meadows.</p>

<p>Underneath the swift-flowing water of a deep river,
the nymph who was the mother of Arist&aelig;us sat on her
throne. Fishes darted round her white feet, and beside
her sat her attendants, spinning the fine strong green
cords that twine themselves round the throats of those
who perish when their arms can no longer fight against
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg&nbsp;156]</a></span>
the force of the rushing current. A nymph sang as she
worked, an old, old song, that told one of the old, old
tales of man&rsquo;s weakness and the power of the creatures
of water, but above her song those who listened heard
a man&rsquo;s voice, calling loudly and pitifully.</p>

<p>The voice was that of Arist&aelig;us, calling aloud for his
mother. Then his mother gave command, and the
waters of the river rolled asunder and let Arist&aelig;us pass
down far below to where the fountains of the great
rivers lie. A mighty roar of many waters dinned in his
ears as the rivers started on the race that was to bring
them all at last to their restless haven, the Ocean. To
Cyrene he came at length, and to her told his sorrowful
tale:</p>

<p>&ldquo;To men who live their little lives and work and
die as I myself&mdash;though son of a nymph and of a god&mdash;must
do,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have brought two great gifts,
oh my mother. I have taught them that from the grey
olives they can reap a priceless harvest, and from me
they have learned that the little brown bees that hum
in and out of the flowers may be made slaves that bring
to them the sweetest riches of which Nature may be
robbed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This do I already know, my son,&rdquo; said Cyrene, and
smiled upon Arist&aelig;us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet dost thou not know,&rdquo; said Arist&aelig;us, &ldquo;the
doom that has overtaken my army of busy workers.
No longer does there come from my city of bees the
boom of many wings and many busy little feet as they
fly, swift and strong, hither and thither, to bring back
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg&nbsp;157]</a></span>
to the hives their honeyed treasure. The comb is empty.
The bees are all dead&mdash;or, if not dead, they have forsaken
me forever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then spoke Cyrene. &ldquo;Hast heard, my son,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;of Proteus? It is he who herds the flocks of
the boundless sea. On days when the South Wind and
the North Wind wrestle together, and when the Wind
from the East smites the West Wind in shame before
him, thou mayst see him raise his snowy head and long
white beard above the grey-green waves of the sea,
and lash the white-maned, unbridled, fierce sea-horses
into fury before him. Proteus only&mdash;none but Proteus&mdash;can
tell thee by what art thou canst win thy bees
back once more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Arist&aelig;us with eagerness questioned his mother
how he might find Proteus and gain from him the
knowledge that he sought, and Cyrene answered: &ldquo;No
matter how piteously thou dost entreat him, never,
save by force, wilt thou gain his secret from Proteus.
Only if thou canst chain him by guile as he sleeps and
hold fast the chains, undaunted by the shapes into which
he has the power to change himself, wilt thou win his
knowledge from him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Cyrene sprinkled her son with the nectar of
the deathless gods, and in his heart there was born a
noble courage and through him a new life seemed to run.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lead me now to Proteus, oh my mother!&rdquo; he
said, and Cyrene left her throne and led him to the
cave where Proteus, herdsman of the seas, had his
dwelling. Behind the seaweed-covered rocks Arist&aelig;us
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg&nbsp;158]</a></span>
concealed himself, while the nymph used the fleecy clouds
for her covering. And when Apollo drove his chariot
across the high heavens at noon, and all land and all sea
were hot as molten gold, Proteus with his flocks returned
to the shade of his great cave by the sobbing sea, and on
its sandy floor he stretched himself, and soon lay, his
limbs all lax and restful, in the exquisite joy of a dreamless
sleep. From behind the rocks Arist&aelig;us watched
him, and when, at length, he saw that Proteus slept too
soundly to wake gently he stepped forward, and on the
sleep-drowsed limbs of Proteus fixed the fetters that
made him his captive. Then, in joy and pride at having
been the undoing of the shepherd of the seas, Arist&aelig;us
shouted aloud. And Proteus, awaking, swiftly turned
himself into a wild boar with white tusks that lusted
to thrust themselves into the thighs of Arist&aelig;us. But
Arist&aelig;us, unflinching, kept his firm hold of the chain.
Next did he become a tiger, tawny and velvet black,
and fierce to devour. And still Arist&aelig;us held the chain,
and never let his eye fall before the glare of the
beast that sought to devour him. A scaly dragon came
next, breathing out flames, and yet Arist&aelig;us held him.
Then came a lion, its yellow pelt scented with the lust
of killing, and while Arist&aelig;us yet strove against him
there came to terrify his listening ears the sound of fire
that lapped up and thirstily devoured all things that
would stand against it. And ere the crackle of the
flames and their great sigh of fierce desire had ceased,
there came in his ears the sound of many waters, the
booming rush of an angry river in furious flood, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg&nbsp;159]</a></span>
irresistible command of the almighty waves of the sea. Yet
still Arist&aelig;us held the chains, and at last Proteus took
his own shape again, and with a sigh like the sigh of
winds and waves on the desolate places where ships become
wrecks, and men perish and there is never a human soul
to save or to pity them, he spoke to Arist&aelig;us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Puny one!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and puny are thy wishes!
Because thou didst by thy foolish wooing send the
beautiful Eurydice swiftly down to the Shades and
break the heart of Orpheus, whose music is the music of
the Immortals, the bees that thou hast treasured have
left their hives empty and silent. So little are the bees!
so great, O Arist&aelig;us, the bliss or woe of Orpheus and
Eurydice! Yet, because by guile thou hast won the
power to gain from me the knowledge that thou dost
seek, hearken to me now, Arist&aelig;us! Four bulls must
thou find&mdash;four cows of equal beauty. Then must thou
build in a leafy grove four altars, and to Orpheus and
Eurydice pay such funeral honours as may allay their
resentment. At the end of nine days, when thou hast
fulfilled thy pious task, return and see what the gods
have sent thee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This will I do most faithfully, O Proteus,&rdquo; said
Arist&aelig;us, and gravely loosened the chains and returned
to where his mother awaited him, and thence travelled
to his own sunny land of Greece.</p>

<p>Most faithfully, as he had said, did Arist&aelig;us perform
his vow. And when, on the ninth day, he returned to
the grove of sacrifice, a sound greeted him which made
his heart stop and then go on beating and throbbing as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg&nbsp;160]</a></span>
the heart of a man who has striven valiantly in a great
fight and to whom the battle is assured.</p>

<p>For, from the carcase of one of the animals offered
for sacrifice, and whose clean white bones now gleamed
in the rays of the sun that forced its way through the
thick shade of the grove of grey olives, there came the
&ldquo;murmuring of innumerable bees.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Out of the eater came forth meat, out of the strong
came forth sweetness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Arist&aelig;us, a Samson of the old Greek days,
rejoiced exceedingly, knowing that his thoughtless sin
was pardoned, and that for evermore to him belonged
the pride of giving to all men the power of taming bees,
the glory of mastering the little brown creatures that
pillage from the fragrant, bright-hued flowers their
most precious treasure.</p>

<p>The story of Persephone&mdash;of Proserpine&mdash;is a story of
spring. When the sun is warming the bare brown earth,
and the pale primroses look up through the snowy blackthorns
at a kind, blue sky, almost can we hear the soft
wind murmur a name as it gently sways the daffodils
and breathes through the honey sweetness of the gold-powdered
catkins on the grey willows by the river&mdash;&ldquo;Persephone!
Persephone!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now once there was a time when there was no spring,
neither summer nor autumn, nor chilly winter with
its black frosts and cruel gales and brief, dark days.
Always was there sunshine and warmth, ever were there
flowers and corn and fruit, and nowhere did the flowers
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg&nbsp;162]</a></span>
grow with more dazzling colours and more fragrant perfume
than in the fair garden of Sicily.</p>

<p>To Demeter, the Earth Mother, was born a daughter
more fair than any flower that grew, and ever more dear
to her became her child, the lovely Proserpine. By the
blue sea, in the Sicilian meadows, Proserpine and the fair
nymphs who were her companions spent their happy days.
Too short were the days for all their joy, and Demeter
made the earth yet fairer than it was that she might
bring more gladness to her daughter Proserpine. Each
day the blossoms that the nymphs twined into garlands
grew more perfect in form and in hue, but from the
anemones of royal purple and crimson, and the riotous
red of geraniums, Proserpine turned one morning with
a cry of gladness, for there stood before her beside
a little stream, on one erect, slim stem, a wonderful
narcissus, with a hundred blossoms. Her eager hand
was stretched out to pluck it, when a sudden black cloud
overshadowed the land, and the nymphs, with shrieks of
fear, fled swiftly away. And as the cloud descended,
there was heard a terrible sound, as of the rushing of
many waters or the roll of the heavy wheels of the
chariot of one who comes to slay. Then was the earth
cleft open, and from it there arose the four coal-black
horses of Pluto, neighing aloud in their eagerness, while
the dark-browed god urged them on, standing erect in his
car of gold.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;The coal-black horses rise&mdash;they rise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O mother, mother!&rsquo; low she cries&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Persephone&mdash;Persephone!<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg&nbsp;163]</a></span>
<span class="i0">&lsquo;O light, light, light!&rsquo; she cries, &lsquo;farewell;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The coal-black horses wait for me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O shade of shades, where I must dwell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Demeter, mother, far from thee!&rsquo;&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a><br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>In cold, strong arms Pluto seized her&mdash;in that mighty
grasp that will not be denied, and Proserpine wept
childish tears as she shivered at his icy touch, and
sobbed because she had dropped the flowers she had
picked, and had never picked the flower she most desired.
While still she saw the fair light of day, the little
oddly-shaped rocky hills, the vineyards and olive groves
and flowery meadows of Sicily, she did not lose hope.
Surely the King of Terrors could not steal one so young,
so happy, and so fair. She had only tasted the joy of
living, and fain she would drink deeper in the coming
years. Her mother must surely save her&mdash;her mother
who had never yet failed her&mdash;her mother, and the gods.</p>

<p>But ruthless as the mower whose scythe cuts down
the seeded grass and the half-opened flower and lays
them in swathes on the meadow, Pluto drove on. His
iron-coloured reins were loose on the black manes of his
horses, and he urged them forward by name till the
froth flew from their mouths like the foam that the
furious surf of the sea drives before it in a storm. Across
the bay and along the bank of the river Anapus they
galloped, until, at the river head, they came to the pool
of Cyane. He smote the water with his trident, and
downward into the blackness of darkness his horses
passed, and Proserpine knew no more the pleasant
light of day.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg&nbsp;164]</a></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;What ails her that she comes not home?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Demeter seeks her far and wide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gloomy-browed doth ceaseless roam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From many a morn till eventide.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&lsquo;My life, immortal though it be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is nought,&rsquo; she cries, &lsquo;for want of thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Persephone&mdash;Persephone!&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>So, to the great Earth Mother came the pangs that
have drawn tears of blood from many a mortal mother&rsquo;s
heart for a child borne off to the Shades.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;My life is nought for want of thee,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Persephone! Persephone!&rsquo;&rdquo; ...<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>The cry is borne down through the ages, to echo and re-echo
so long as mothers love and Death is still unchained.</p>

<p>Over land and sea, from where Dawn, the rosy-fingered,
rises in the East, to where Apollo cools the
fiery wheels of his chariot in the waters of far western
seas, the goddess sought her daughter. With a black
robe over her head and carrying a flaming torch in either
hand, for nine dreary days she sought her loved one.
And yet, for nine more weary days and nine sleepless
nights the goddess, racked by human sorrow, sat in
hopeless misery. The hot sun beat upon her by day.
By night the silver rays from Diana&rsquo;s car smote her more
gently, and the dew drenched her hair and her black
garments and mingled with the saltness of her bitter
tears. At the grey dawning of the tenth day her elder
daughter, Hecate, stood beside her. Queen of ghosts and
shades was she, and to her all dark places of the earth
were known.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us go to the Sun God,&rdquo; said Hecate. &ldquo;Surely
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg&nbsp;165]</a></span>
he hath seen the god who stole away the little Proserpine.
Soon his chariot will drive across the heavens.
Come, let us ask him to guide us to the place where she
is hidden.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus did they come to the chariot of the glorious
Apollo, and standing by the heads of his horses like
two grey clouds that bar the passage of the sun, they
begged him to tell them the name of him who had stolen
fair Proserpine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No less a thief was he,&rdquo; said Apollo, &ldquo;than Pluto,
King of Darkness and robber of Life itself. Mourn
not, Demeter. Thy daughter is safe in his keeping.
The little nymph who played in the meadows is now
Queen of the Shades. Nor does Pluto love her vainly.
She is now in love with Death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No comfort did the words of the Sun God bring to
the longing soul of Demeter. And her wounded heart
grew bitter. Because she suffered, others must suffer
as well. Because she mourned, all the world must
mourn. The fragrant flowers spoke to her only of
Persephone, the purple grapes reminded her of a vintage
when the white fingers of her child had plucked the
fruit. The waving golden grain told her that Persephone
was as an ear of wheat that is reaped before its time.</p>

<p>Then upon the earth did there come dearth and
drought and barrenness.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;The wheat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was blighted in the ear, the purple grapes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blushed no more on the vines, and all the gods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were sorrowful ...&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg&nbsp;166]</a></span>
Gods and men alike suffered from the sorrow of
Demeter. To her, in pity for the barren earth, Zeus
sent an embassy, but in vain it came. Merciless was the
great Earth Mother, who had been robbed of what she
held most dear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give me back my child!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Gladly I
watch the sufferings of men, for no sorrow is as my
sorrow. Give me back my child, and the earth shall
grow fertile once more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Unwillingly Zeus granted the request of Demeter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She shall come back,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;and with
thee dwell on earth forever. Yet only on one condition
do I grant thy fond request. Persephone must eat no
food through all the time of her sojourn in the realm
of Pluto, else must thy beseeching be all in vain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then did Demeter gladly leave Olympus and hasten
down to the darkness of the shadowy land that once
again she might hold, in her strong mother&rsquo;s arms, her
who had once been her little clinging child.</p>

<p>But in the dark kingdom of Pluto a strange thing
had happened. No longer had the pale-faced god, with
dark locks, and eyes like the sunless pools of a mountain
stream, any terrors for Proserpine. He was strong,
and cruel had she thought him, yet now she knew that
the touch of his strong, cold hands was a touch of infinite
tenderness. When, knowing the fiat of the ruler
of Olympus, Pluto gave to his stolen bride a pomegranate,
red in heart as the heart of a man, she had
taken it from his hand, and, because he willed it, had eaten
of the sweet seeds. Then, in truth, it was too late for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg&nbsp;167]</a></span>
Demeter to save her child. She &ldquo;had eaten of Love&rsquo;s
seed&rdquo; and &ldquo;changed into another.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;He takes the cleft pomegranate seeds:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Love, eat with me this parting day;&rsquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then bids them fetch the coal-black steeds&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Demeter&rsquo;s daughter, wouldst away?&rsquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gates of Hades set her free;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&lsquo;She will return full soon,&rsquo; saith he&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&lsquo;My wife, my wife Persephone.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Dark, dark was the kingdom of Pluto. Its rivers
never mirrored a sunbeam, and ever moaned low as an
earthly river moans before a coming flood, and the feet
that trod the gloomy Cocytus valley were the feet of
those who never again would tread on the soft grass and
flowers of an earthly meadow. Yet when Demeter had
braved all the shadows of Hades, only in part was her
end accomplished. In part only was Proserpine now
her child, for while half her heart was in the sunshine,
rejoicing in the beauties of earth, the other half was
with the god who had taken her down to the Land of
Darkness and there had won her for his own. Back to
the flowery island of Sicily her mother brought her, and
the peach trees and the almonds blossomed snowily
as she passed. The olives decked themselves with their
soft grey leaves, the corn sprang up, green and lush and
strong. The lemon and orange groves grew golden with
luscious fruit, and all the land was carpeted with flowers.
For six months of the year she stayed, and gods and
men rejoiced at the bringing back of Proserpine. For
six months she left her green and pleasant land for the
dark kingdom of him whom she loved, and through
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg&nbsp;168]</a></span>
those months the trees were bare, and the earth chill
and brown, and under the earth the flowers hid themselves
in fear and awaited the return of the fair daughter
of Demeter.</p>

<p>And evermore has she come and gone, and seedtime
and harvest have never failed, and the cold, sleeping
world has awaked and rejoiced, and heralded with
the song of birds, and the bursting of green buds and
the blooming of flowers, the resurrection from the dead&mdash;the
coming of spring.</p>

<h2>LATONA AND THE RUSTICS</h2>


<p>Through the tropic nights their sonorous, bell-like
booming can be heard coming up from the marshes, and
when they are unseen, the song of the bull-frogs would
suggest creatures full of solemn dignity. The croak of
their lesser brethren is less impressive, yet there is no
escape from it on those evenings when the dragon-flies&rsquo;
iridescent wings are folded in sleep, and the birds in the
branches are still, when the lilies on the pond have
closed their golden hearts, and even the late-feeding
trout have ceased to plop and to make eddies in the
quiet water. &ldquo;Krroak! krroak! krroak!&rdquo; they go&mdash;&ldquo;krroak!
krroak! krroak!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is unceasing, unending. It goes on like the whirr
of the wheels of a great clock that can never run down&mdash;a
melancholy complaint against the hardships of destiny&mdash;a
raucous protest against things as they are.</p>

<p>This is the story of the frogs that have helped to
point the gibes of Aristophanes, the morals of &AElig;sop, and
which have always been, more or less, regarded as the
low comedians of the animal world.</p>

<p>Latona, or Leto, was the goddess of dark nights,
and upon her the mighty Zeus bestowed the doubtful
favour of his errant love. Great was the wrath of Hera,
his queen, when she found that she was no longer the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg&nbsp;170]</a></span>
dearest wife of her omnipotent lord, and with furious
upbraidings she banished her rival to earth. And when
Latona had reached the place of her exile she found that
the vengeful goddess had sworn that she would place her
everlasting ban upon anyone, mortal or immortal, who
dared to show any kindness or pity to her whose only
fault had been that Zeus loved her. From place to place
she wandered, an outcast even among men, until, at
length, she came to Lycia.</p>

<p>One evening, as the darkness of which she was goddess
had just begun to fall, she reached a green and pleasant
valley. The soft, cool grass was a delight to her tired
feet, and when she saw the silvery gleam of water she
rejoiced, for her throat was parched and her lips dry and
she was very weary. By the side of this still pond,
where the lilies floated, there grew lithe grey willows and
fresh green osiers, and these were being cut by a crowd of
chattering rustics.</p>

<p>Humbly, for many a rude word and harsh rebuff had
the dictum of Hera brought her during her wanderings,
Latona went to the edge of the pond, and, kneeling
down, was most thankfully about to drink, when the
peasants espied her. Roughly and rudely they told
her to begone, nor dare to drink unbidden of the clear
water beside which their willows grew. Very pitifully
Latona looked up in their churlish faces, and her eyes
were as the eyes of a doe that the hunters have pressed
very hard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely, good people,&rdquo; she said, and her voice was
sad and low, &ldquo;water is free to all. Very far have I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg&nbsp;171]</a></span>
travelled, and I am aweary almost to death. Only grant
that I dip my lips in the water for one deep draught.
Of thy pity grant me this boon, for I perish of thirst.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harsh and coarse were the mocking voices that made
answer. Coarser still were the jests that they made.
Then one, bolder than his fellows, spurned her kneeling
figure with his foot, while another brushed before her
and stepping into the pond, defiled its clarity by churning
up the mud that lay below with his great splay
feet.</p>

<p>Loudly the peasants laughed at this merry jest, and
they quickly followed his lead, as brainless sheep will
follow the one that scrambles through a gap. Soon they
were all joyously stamping and dancing in what had
so lately been a pellucid pool. The water-lilies and
blue forget-me-nots were trodden down, the fish that
had their homes under the mossy stones in terror fled
away. Only the mud came up, filthy, defiling, and the
rustics laughed in loud and foolish laughter to see the
havoc they had wrought.</p>

<p>The goddess Latona rose from her knees. No
longer did she seem a mere woman, very weary, hungry
and athirst, travelled over far. In their surprised eyes
she grew to a stature that was as that of the deathless
gods. And her eyes were dark as an angry sea at even.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shameless ones!&rdquo; she said, in a voice as the
voice of a storm that sweeps destroyingly over forest and
mountain. &ldquo;Ah! shameless ones! Is it thus that
thou wouldst defy one who has dwelt on Olympus?
Behold from henceforth shalt thou have thy dwelling
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg&nbsp;172]</a></span>
in the mud of the green-scummed pools, thy homes in
the water that thy flat feet have defiled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As she spoke, a change, strange and terrible, passed
over the forms of the trampling peasants. Their stature
shrank. They grew squat and fat. Their hands and
feet were webbed, and their grinning mouths became
great, sad, gaping openings by which to swallow worms
and flies. Green and yellow and brown were their skins,
and when they would fain have cried aloud for mercy,
from their throats there would come only the &ldquo;<em>Krroak!
krroak! krroak!</em>&rdquo; that we know so well.</p>

<p>And when, that night, the goddess of darkness was
wrapped in peace in the black, silver star bespangled
robe that none could take from her, there arose from the
pond over which the grey willows hung, weeping, the
clamour of a great lamentation. Yet no piteous words
were there, only the incessant, harsh complaint of the
frogs that we hear in the marshes.</p>

<p>From that time the world went well with Latona.
Down to the seashore she came, and when she held
out her arms in longing appeal to the &AElig;gean islands
that lay like purple flowers strewn, far apart, on a
soft carpet of limpid blue, Zeus heard her prayer. He
asked Poseidon to send a dolphin to carry the woman
he loved to the floating island of Delos, and when she
had been borne there in safety, he chained the island
with chains of adamant to the golden-sanded floor of
the sea.</p>

<h2>ECHO AND NARCISSUS</h2>


<p>In the solitudes of the hills we find her, and yet we may
come on her unawares in the din of a noisy city. She
will answer us where the waves are lashing themselves
against the rugged cliffs of our own British coast, or we
may find her where the great yellow pillars of fallen
temples lie hot in the sun close to the vivid blue water
of the African sea. At nightfall, on the lonely northern
moors, she mimics the cry of a wailing bird that calls for
its mate, but it is she who prolongs the roll of the great
organ in a vast cathedral, she who repeats the rattle
and crack and boom of the guns, no matter in what
land the war may be raging. In the desolate Australian
bush she makes the crash of the falling limb of a dead
gum tree go on and on, and tortures the human being
who is lost, hopelessly lost, and facing a cruel death, by
repeating his despairing calls for help. Through the
night, in old country-houses, she sports at will and gives
new life to sad old tales of the restless dead who restlessly
walk. But she echoes the children&rsquo;s voices as they
play by the seashore or pick primroses in the woods in
spring, and when they greet her with laughter, she
laughs in merry response. They may fear her when
the sun has gone down, and when they are left all alone
they begin to dread her mockery. Yet the nymph who
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg&nbsp;175]</a></span>
sought for love and failed to gain what she sought
must surely find some comfort on those bright days of
summer and of spring when she gives the little children
happiness and they give her their love.</p>

<p>When all the world was young, and nymphs and
fauns and dryads dwelt in the forests, there was no
nymph more lovely and more gay than she whose
name was Echo. Diana would smile on her for her
fleetness of foot when she followed her in the chase,
and those whom she met in the leafy pathways of the
dim, green woods, would pass on smiling at the remembrance
of her merry chatter and her tricksy humour.</p>

<p>It was an evil day for Echo when she crossed the path
of Hera, queen of the gods. The jealous goddess sought
her errant husband, who was amusing himself with some
nymphs, and Echo, full of mischievous glee, kept her in
talk until the nymphs had fled to safety. Hera was
furious indeed when she found out that a frolicsome
nymph had dared to play on her such a trick, and ruthlessly
she spoke fair Echo&rsquo;s doom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Henceforth,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the tongue with which
thou hast cheated me shall be in bonds. No longer
wilt thou have the power to speak in greeting. To the
tongues of others shall thy tongue be slave, and from
this day until time shall cease thou shalt speak only to
repeat the last words that have fallen on thine ears.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A maimed nymph indeed was Echo then, yet whole
in all that matters most, in that her merry heart was
still her own. But only for a little while did this endure.</p>

<p>Narcissus, the beautiful son of a nymph and a river
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg&nbsp;176]</a></span>
god, was hunting in a lonely forest one day when Echo
saw him pass. To her he seemed more fair than god or
man, and once she had seen him she knew that she must
gain his love or die. From that day on, she haunted
him like his shadow, gliding from tree to tree, nestling
down amongst thick fern and undergrowth, motionless
as one who stalks a wild thing, watching him afar off
while he rested, gladdening her eyes with his beauty.
So did she feed her hungering heart, and sought to find
contentment by looking on his face each day.</p>

<p>To her at length came a perfect moment when Narcissus
was separated from his companions in the chase
and, stopping suddenly where the evening sun chequered
the pathway of the forest with black and gold, heard the
nymph&rsquo;s soft footfall on the rustling leaves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s here?&rdquo; he called.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Here!</em>&rdquo; answered Echo.</p>

<p>Narcissus, peering amongst the trees&rsquo; long shadows
and seeing no one, called &ldquo;Come!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And &ldquo;<em>Come!</em>&rdquo; called the glad voice of Echo, while
the nymph, with fast-beating heart, felt that her day of
happiness had come indeed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you shun me?&rdquo; then called Narcissus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Why do you shun me?</em>&rdquo; Echo repeated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us join one another,&rdquo; said the lad, and the
simple words seemed turned into song when Echo said
them over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Let us join one another!</em>&rdquo; she said, and not Eos
herself, as with rosy fingers she turns aside the dark
clouds of night, could be fairer than was the nymph as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg&nbsp;177]</a></span>
she pushed aside the leaves of the trackless wood, and
ran forward with white arms outstretched to him who
was lord of her life.</p>

<span class="caption">SHE HAUNTED HIM LIKE HIS SHADOW</span>
</div>

<p>With cold eyes and colder heart the one she loved
beheld her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Away!&rdquo; he cried, shrinking back as if from something
that he hated. &ldquo;<em>Away!</em> I would rather die than
that you should have me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Have me!</em>&rdquo; cried Echo pitifully, but she pled in
vain. Narcissus had no love to give her, and his scorn
filled her with shame. Thenceforth in the forest revels
she never more was seen, and the nymphs danced gaily
as ever, with never a care for her who had faded and gone
away as completely as though she were a blossom in
the passing of spring. In the solitude of mountain
cliffs and caves and rocky places, and in the loneliest
depths of the forest, Echo hid her grief, and when the
winds blew through the dark branches of the trees at
night, moaning and sighing, they could hear far below
them the voice of Echo repeating their lamentations.
For her, long nights followed hopeless days, and nights
and days only told her that her love was all in vain.
Then came a night when the winds no longer saw the
figure of the nymph, white and frail as a broken flower,
crouching close to the rocks they passed over. Grief
had slain the body of Echo. Only her voice was left
to repeat their mocking laughter, their wistful sighs&mdash;only
her voice that lives on still though all the old gods
are gone, and but few there are who know her story.</p>

<p>Heartwhole and happy, Narcissus, slayer of happiness,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg&nbsp;178]</a></span>
went on his way, and other nymphs besides fair Echo
suffered from loving him in vain. One nymph, less
gentle than Echo, poured the tale of her love that was
scorned into the sympathetic ears of the goddess of Love,
and implored her to punish Narcissus.</p>

<p>Hot and tired from the chase, Narcissus sought one
day a lonely pool in the woods, there to rest and to quench
his thirst.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;In some delicious ramble, he had found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A little space, with boughs all woven round;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the midst of all, a clearer pool<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than e&rsquo;er reflected in its pleasant cool<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The blue sky here, and there, serenely peeping<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through tendril wreaths fantastically creeping.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>As he stooped down to drink, a face looked at his
through the crystal clear water, and a pair of beautiful
eyes met his own. His surprise and joy at the sight of
what he felt sure must be the most beautiful creature
on earth, was evidently shared by the nymph of the
pool, who gazed fearlessly up at him.</p>

<p>Round her head she had a nimbus of curls than which
that of Adonis&mdash;nay, of the sun-god himself, was not
more perfect, while her eyes were like the brown pools
of water in a rippling mountain stream, flecked with
sunshine, yet with depths untold. When Narcissus
smiled at her in rapture, her red lips also parted in a
smile. He stretched out his arms towards her, and her
arms were stretched to him. Almost trembling in his
delight, he slowly stooped to kiss her. Nearer she drew
to him, nearer still, but when his mouth would have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg&nbsp;179]</a></span>
given itself to that other mouth that was formed like the
bow of Eros&mdash;a thing to slay hearts&mdash;only the chilly
water of the pool touched his lips, and the thing of his
delight vanished away. In passionate disappointment
Narcissus waited for her to return, and as soon as the
water of the pool grew still, once more he saw her exquisite
face gazing wistfully up into his. Passionately
he pled with the beautiful creature&mdash;spoke of his love&mdash;besought
her to have pity on him, but although the face
in the pool reflected his every look of adoration and of
longing, time and again he vainly tried to clasp in his
arms what was but the mirrored likeness of himself.</p>

<p>In full measure had the avenging goddess meted out
to Narcissus the restless longing of unsatisfied love.
By day and by night he haunted the forest pool, and ere
long the face that looked back at his was pale as a lily
in the dawn. When the moonbeams came straying
down through the branches and all the night was still,
they found him kneeling by the pool, and the white face
that the water mirrored had the eyes of one of the things
of the woods to which a huntsman has given a mortal
wound. Mortally wounded he truly was, slain, like
many another since his day, by a hopeless love for what
was in truth but an image, and that an image of his own
creation. Even when his shade passed across the dark
Stygian river, it stooped over the side of the boat that
it might try to catch a glimpse of the beloved one in the
inky waters.</p>

<p>Echo and the other nymphs were avenged, yet when
they looked on the beautiful dead Narcissus, they were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg&nbsp;180]</a></span>
filled with sorrow, and when they filled the air with
their lamentations, most piteously did the voice of Echo
repeat each mournful cry. Even the gods were pitiful,
and when the nymphs would have burned the body
on a funeral pyre which their own fair hands had built
for him, they sought it in vain. For the Olympians
had turned Narcissus into a white flower, the flower
that still bears his name and keeps his memory sweet.</p>

<h2>ICARUS</h2>


<p>Fourteen years only have passed since our twentieth
century began. In those fourteen years how many a
father&rsquo;s and mother&rsquo;s heart has bled for the death of
gallant sons, greatly-promising, greatly-daring, who
have sought to rule the skies? With wings not well
enough tried, they have soared dauntlessly aloft, only
to add more names to the tragic list of those whose lives
have been sacrificed in order that the groping hands of
science may become sure, so that in time the sons of men
may sail through the heavens as fearlessly as their
fathers sailed through the seas.</p>

<p>High overhead we watch the monoplane, the great,
swooping thing, like a monster black-winged bird, and
our minds travel back to the story of Icarus, who died
so many years ago that there are those who say that his
story is but a foolish fable, an idle myth.</p>

<p>D&aelig;dalus, grandson of a king of Athens, was the
greatest artificer of his day. Not only as an architect
was he great, but as a sculptor he had the creative
power, not only to make men and women and animals
that looked alive, but to cause them to move and to be,
to all appearances, endowed with life. To him the
artificers who followed him owed the invention of the
axe, the wedge, the wimble, and the carpenter&rsquo;s level,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg&nbsp;182]</a></span>
and his restless mind was ever busy with new inventions.
To his nephew, Talus, or Perdrix, he taught all that
he himself knew of all the mechanical arts. Soon it
seemed that the nephew, though he might not excel his
uncle, equalled D&aelig;dalus in his inventive power. As
he walked by the seashore, the lad picked up the spine
of a fish, and, having pondered its possibilities, he took
it home, imitated it in iron, and so invented the saw.
A still greater invention followed this. While those
who had always thought that there could be none greater
than D&aelig;dalus were still acclaiming the lad, there came
to him the idea of putting two pieces of iron together,
connecting them at one end with a rivet, and sharpening
both ends, and a pair of compasses was made.
Louder still were the acclamations of the people. Surely
greater than D&aelig;dalus was here. Too much was this
for the artist&rsquo;s jealous spirit.</p>

<p>One day they stood together on the top of the Acropolis,
and D&aelig;dalus, murder that comes from jealousy in
his heart, threw his nephew down. Down, down he fell,
knowing well that he was going to meet a cruel death,
but Pallas Athen&eacute;, protectress of all clever craftsmen,
came to his rescue. By her Perdrix was turned into the
bird that still bears his name, and D&aelig;dalus beheld Perdrix,
the partridge, rapidly winging his way to the far-off
fields. Since then, no partridge has ever built or roosted
in a high place, but has nestled in the hedge-roots and
amongst the standing corn, and as we mark it we can
see that its flight is always low.</p>

<p>For his crime D&aelig;dalus was banished from Athens,
and in the court of Minos, king of Crete, he found
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg&nbsp;183]</a></span>
a refuge. He put all his mighty powers at the
service of Minos, and for him designed an intricate
labyrinth which, like the river Meander, had neither
beginning nor ending, but ever returned on itself in hopeless
intricacy. Soon he stood high in the favour of the
king, but, ever greedy for power, he incurred, by one of
his daring inventions, the wrath of Minos. The angry
monarch threw him into prison, and imprisoned along
with him his son, Icarus. But prison bars and
locks did not exist that were strong enough to
baffle this master craftsman, and from the tower in
which they were shut, D&aelig;dalus and his son were not
long in making their escape. To escape from Crete
was a less easy matter. There were many places in
that wild island where it was easy for the father and
son to hide, but the subjects of Minos were mostly
mariners, and D&aelig;dalus knew well that all along the shore
they kept watch lest he should make him a boat, hoist
on it one of the sails of which he was part inventor, and
speed away to safety like a sea-bird driven before the
gale. Then did there come to D&aelig;dalus, the pioneer
of inventions, the great idea that by his skill he might
make a way for himself and his son through another
element than water. And he laughed aloud in his
hiding place amongst the cypresses on the hillside at
the thought of how he would baffle the simple sailormen
who watched each creek and beach down on the shore.
Mockingly, too, did he think of King Minos, who had
dared to pit his power against the wits and skill of
D&aelig;dalus, the mighty craftsman.</p>

<p>Many a Cretan bird was sacrificed before the task
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg&nbsp;184]</a></span>
which the inventor had set himself was accomplished.
In a shady forest on the mountains he fashioned light
wooden frames and decked them with feathers, until at
length they looked like the pinions of a great eagle, or of
a swan that flaps its majestic way from lake to river.
Each feather was bound on with wax, and the mechanism
of the wings was so perfect a reproduction of that of the
wings from which the feathers had been plucked, that on
the first day that he fastened them to his back and spread
them out, D&aelig;dalus found that he could fly even as the
bird flew. Two pairs he made; having tested one pair, a
second pair was made for Icarus, and, circling round him
like a mother bird that teaches her nestlings how to
fly, D&aelig;dalus, his heart big with the pride of invention,
showed Icarus how he might best soar upwards to the
sun or dive down to the blue sea far below, and how he
might conquer the winds and the air currents of the sky
and make them his servants.</p>

<p>That was a joyous day for father and son, for the
father had never before drunk deeper of the intoxicating
wine of the gods&mdash;Success&mdash;and for the lad it was all
pure joy. Never before had he known freedom and
power so utterly glorious. As a little child he had
watched the birds fly far away over the blue hills to
where the sun was setting, and had longed for wings
that he might follow them in their flight. At times,
in his dreams, he had known the power, and in his
dreaming fancy had risen from the cumbering earth
and soared high above the trees and fields on strong
pinions that bore him away to the fair land of heart&rsquo;s
desire&mdash;to the Islands of the Blessed. But when Sleep
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg&nbsp;185]</a></span>
left him and the dreams silently slipped out before the
coming of the light of day, and the boy sprang from
his couch and eagerly spread his arms as, in his dreams,
he had done, he could no longer fly. Disappointment
and unsatisfied longing ever came with his waking hours.
Now all that had come to an end, and D&aelig;dalus was
glad and proud as well to watch his son&rsquo;s joy and his fearless
daring. One word of counsel only did he give him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beware, dear son of my heart,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;lest in
thy new-found power thou seekest to soar even to the
gates of Olympus. For as surely as the scorching rays
from the burnished wheels of the chariot of Apollo
smite thy wings, the wax that binds on thy feathers
will melt, and then will come upon thee and on me woe
unutterable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In his dreams that night Icarus flew, and when he
awoke, fearing to find only the haunting remembrance
of a dream, he found his father standing by the side of
his bed of soft leaves under the shadowy cypresses,
ready to bind on his willing shoulders the great pinions
that he had made.</p>

<p>Gentle Dawn, the rosy-fingered, was slowly making
her way up from the East when D&aelig;dalus and Icarus
began their flight. Slowly they went at first, and the
goat-herds who tended their flocks on the slopes of
Mount Ida looked up in fear when they saw the
dark shadows of their wings and marked the monster
birds making their way out to sea. From the river
beds the waterfowl arose from the reeds, and with great
outcry flew with all their swiftness to escape them.
And down by the seashore the mariners&rsquo; hearts sank
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg&nbsp;186]</a></span>
within them as they watched, believing that a sight so
strange must be a portent of disaster. Homewards they
went in haste to offer sacrifices on the altars of Poseidon,
ruler of the deep.</p>

<p>Samos and Delos were passed on the left and
Lebynthos on the right, long ere the sun-god had
started on his daily course, and as the mighty wings
of Icarus cleft the cold air, the boy&rsquo;s slim body grew
chilled, and he longed for the sun&rsquo;s rays to turn the
waters of the &AElig;gean Sea over which he flew from green-grey
into limpid sapphire and emerald and burning gold.
Towards Sicily he and his father bent their course, and
when they saw the beautiful island afar off lying like
a gem in the sea, Apollo made the waves in which it lay,
for it a fitting setting. With a cry of joy Icarus marked
the sun&rsquo;s rays paint the chill water, and Apollo looked
down at the great white-winged bird, a snowy swan
with the face and form of a beautiful boy, who sped
exulting onwards, while a clumsier thing, with wings of
darker hue, followed less quickly, in the same line of
flight. As the god looked, the warmth that radiated
from his chariot touched the icy limbs of Icarus as with
the caressing touch of gentle, life-giving hands. Not
long before, his flight had lagged a little, but now it
seemed as if new life was his. Like a bird that wheels
and soars and dives as if for lightness of heart, so did
Icarus, until each feather of his plumage had a sheen of
silver and of gold. Down, down, he darted, so near
the water that almost the white-tipped waves caught
at his wings as he skimmed over them. Then up, up,
up he soared, ever higher, higher still, and when he saw
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg&nbsp;187]</a></span>
the radiant sun-god smiling down on him, the warning
of D&aelig;dalus was forgotten. As he had excelled other
lads in foot races, now did Icarus wish to excel the
birds themselves. D&aelig;dalus he left far behind, and still
upwards he mounted. So strong he felt, so fearless
was he, that to him it seemed that he could storm
Olympus, that he could call to Apollo as he swept past
him in his flight, and dare him to race for a wager from
the &AElig;gean Sea to where the sun-god&rsquo;s horses took their
nightly rest by the trackless seas of the unknown West.</p>

<p>In terror his father watched him, and as he called
to him in a voice of anguished warning that was drowned
by the whistling rush of the air currents through the
wings of Icarus and the moist whisper of the clouds as
through them he cleft a way for himself, there befell
the dreaded thing. It seemed as though the strong
wings had begun to lose their power. Like a wounded
bird Icarus fluttered, lunged sidewise from the straight,
clean line of his flight, recovered himself, and fluttered
again. And then, like the bird into whose soft breast
the sure hand of a mighty archer has driven an arrow,
downwards he fell, turning over and yet turning again,
downwards, ever downwards, until he fell with a plunge
into the sea that still was radiant in shining emerald and
translucent blue.</p>

<p>Then did the car of Apollo drive on. His rays had
slain one who was too greatly daring, and now they
fondled the little white feathers that had fallen from
the broken wings and floated on the water like the
petals of a torn flower.</p>

<p>On the dead, still face of Icarus they shone, and they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg&nbsp;188]</a></span>
spangled as if with diamonds the wet plumage that still,
widespread, bore him up on the waves.</p>

<p>Stricken at heart was D&aelig;dalus, but there was no
time to lament his son&rsquo;s untimely end, for even now
the black-prowed ships of Minos might be in pursuit.
Onward he flew to safety, and in Sicily built a temple to
Apollo, and there hung up his wings as a propitiatory
offering to the god who had slain his son.</p>

<p>And when grey night came down on that part of the
sea that bears the name of Icarus to this day, still there
floated the body of the boy whose dreams had come
true. For only a little while had he known the exquisite
realisation of dreamed-of potentialities, for only
a few hours tasted the sweetness of perfect pleasure,
and then, by an over-daring flight, had lost it all for ever.</p>

<p>The sorrowing Nereids sang a dirge over him as he
was swayed gently hither and thither by the tide, and
when the silver stars came out from the dark firmament
of heaven and were reflected in the blackness of
the sea at night, it was as though a velvet pall, silver-decked
in his honour, was spread around the slim white
body with its outstretched snowy wings.</p>

<p>So much had he dared&mdash;so little accomplished.</p>

<p>Is it not the oft-told tale of those who have followed
Icarus? Yet who can say that gallant youth has lived
in vain when, as Icarus did, he has breasted the very skies,
has flown with fearless heart and soul to the provinces of
the deathless gods?&mdash;when, even for the space of a few
of the heart-beats of Time, he has tasted supreme power&mdash;the
ecstasy of illimitable happiness?</p>

<h2>CLYTIE</h2>


<p>The sunbeams are basking on the high walls of the old
garden&mdash;smiling on the fruit that grows red and golden
in their warmth. The bees are humming round the
bed of purple heliotrope, and drowsily murmuring in
the shelter of the soft petals of the blush roses whose
sweetness brings back the fragrance of days that are
gone. On the old grey sundial the white-winged pigeons
sleepily croon as they preen their snowy plumage, and
the Madonna lilies hang their heads like a procession
of white-robed nuns who dare not look up from telling
their beads until the triumphal procession of an all-conquering
warrior has gone by. What can they think of
that long line of tall yellow flowers by the garden wall,
who turn their faces sunwards with an arrogant assurance,
and give stare for stare to golden-haired Apollo as
he drives his blazing car triumphant through the high
heavens?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sunflowers&rdquo; is the name by which we know
those flamboyant blossoms which somehow fail so
wholly to suggest the story of Clytie, the nymph whose
destruction came from a faithful, unrequited love.
She was a water-nymph, a timid, gentle being who frequented
lonely streams, and bathed where the blue dragon-flies
dart across the white water-lilies in pellucid lakes.
In the shade of the tall poplar trees and the silvery
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg&nbsp;190]</a></span>
willows she took her midday rest, and feared the hours
when the flowers drooped their heads and the rippling
water lost its coolness before the fierce glare of the sun.</p>

<p>But there came a day when, into the dark pool
by which she sat, Apollo the Conqueror looked down
and mirrored his face. And nevermore did she hide
from the golden-haired god who, from the moment
when she had seen in the water the picture of his radiant
beauty, became the lord and master of her heart and
soul. All night she awaited his coming, and the Dawn
saw her looking eastward for the first golden gleams
from the wheels of his chariot. All day she followed
him with her longing gaze, nor did she ever cease to
feast her eyes upon his beauty until the last reflection of
his radiance had faded from the western sky.</p>

<p>Such devotion might have touched the heart of the
sun-god, but he had no wish to own a love for which he
had not sought. The nymph&rsquo;s adoration irked him, nor
did pity come as Love&rsquo;s pale substitute when he marked
how, day by day, her face grew whiter and more white,
and her lovely form wasted away. For nine days,
without food or drink, she kept her shamed vigil. Only
one word of love did she crave. Unexacting in the
humility of her devotion, she would gratefully have
nourished her hungry heart upon one kindly glance.
But Apollo, full of scorn and anger, lashed up his fiery
steeds as he each day drove past her, nor deigned for her
a glance more gentle than that which he threw on the
satyrs as they hid in the dense green foliage of the
shadowy woods.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg&nbsp;191]</a></span>
Half-mocking, Diana said, &ldquo;In truth the fair nymph
who throws her heart&rsquo;s treasures at the feet of my
golden-locked brother that he may trample on them, is
coming to look like a faded flower!&rdquo; And, as she spoke,
the hearts of the other immortal dwellers in Olympus
were stirred with pity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A flower she shall be!&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;and for all
time shall she live, in life that is renewed each year when
the earth stirs with the quickening of spring. The long
summer days shall she spend forever in fearless worship
of the god of her love!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, as they willed, the nymph passed out of her
human form, and took the form of a flower, and evermore&mdash;the
emblem of constancy&mdash;does she gaze with
fearless ardour on the face of her love.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;The heart that has truly loved never forgets,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But as truly loves on to the close;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the sunflower turns on her god when he sets<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The same look that she turned when he rose.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Some there are who say that not into the bold-faced
sunflower did her metamorphosis take place, but into
that purple heliotrope that gives an exquisite offering
of fragrance to the sun-god when his warm rays touch
it. And in the old walled garden, while the bees
drowsily hum, and the white pigeons croon, and the
dashing sunflower gives Apollo gaze for gaze, and the
scent of the mignonette mingles with that of clove pinks
and blush roses, the fragrance of the heliotrope is, above
all, worthy incense to be offered upon his altar by the
devout lover of a god.</p>

<h2>THE CRANES OF IBYCUS</h2>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With most miraculous organ.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Shakespeare.</span></p>


<p>Ibycus, the poet friend of Apollo, was a happy man as
he journeyed on foot through the country where the
wild flowers grew thick and the trees were laden with
blossom towards the city of Corinth. His tuneful voice
sang snatches of song of his own making, and ever and
again he would try how his words and music sounded on
his lyre. He was light of heart, because ever had he
thought of good, and not evil, and had always sung only
of great and noble deeds and of those things that helped
his fellow-men. And now he went to Corinth for the
great chariot-races, and for the great contest of musicians
where every true poet and musician in Greece was sure to
be found.</p>

<p>It was the time of the return to earth of Adonis and
of Proserpine, and as he was reverently about to enter
the sacred grove of Poseidon, where the trees grew
thick, and saw, crowning the height before him, the
glittering towers of Corinth, he heard, overhead, the
harsh cries of some other returned exiles. Ibycus
smiled, as he looked up and beheld the great flock of
grey birds, with their long legs and strong, outstretched
wings, come back from their winter sojourn on the golden
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg&nbsp;193]</a></span>
sands of Egypt, to dance and beck and bow to each
other by the marshes of his homeland.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Welcome back, little brothers!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;May
you and I both meet with naught but kindness from the
people of this land!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And when the cranes again harshly cried, as if in
answer to his greeting, the poet walked gaily on, further
into the shadow of that dark wood out of which he was
never to pass as living man. Joyous, and fearing no
evil, he had been struck and cast to the ground by cruel
and murderous hands ere ever he knew that two robbers
were hidden in a narrow pass where the brushwood grew
thick. With all his strength he fought, but his arms
were those of a musician and not of a warrior, and very
soon he was overpowered by those who assailed him.
He cried in vain to gods and to men for help, and in his
final agony he heard once more the harsh voices of the
migratory birds and the rush of their speeding wings.
From the ground, where he bled to death, he looked up
to them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take up my cause, dear cranes!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;since
no voice but yours answers my cry!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the cranes screamed hoarsely and mournfully
as if in farewell, as they flapped their way towards
Corinth and left the poet lying dead.</p>

<p>When his body was found, robbed and terribly
wounded, from all over Greece, where he was known
and loved, there uprose a great clamour of lamentation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it thus I find you restored to me?&rdquo; said he who
had expected him in Corinth as his honoured guest;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg&nbsp;194]</a></span>
&ldquo;I who hoped to place the victor&rsquo;s laurels on your head
when you triumphed in the temple of song!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And all those whom the loving personality of Ibycus
and the charm of his music had made his friends were
alert and eager to avenge so foul a murder. But none
knew how the wicked deed had come to pass&mdash;none,
save the cranes.</p>

<p>Then came the day to which Ibycus had looked
forward with such joy, when thousands upon thousands
of his countrymen sat in the theatre at Cyprus and
watched a play that stirred their hearts within them.</p>

<p>The theatre had for roof the blue vault of heaven; the
sun served for footlights and for the lights above
the heads of those who acted. The three Furies&mdash;the
Eumenides&mdash;with their hard and cruel faces and
snaky locks, and with blood dripping from their eyes,
were represented by actors so great that the hearts of
their beholders trembled within them. In their dread
hands lay the punishment of murder, of inhospitality,
of ingratitude, and of all the cruellest and basest of
crimes. Theirs was the duty of hurrying the doomed
spirits entrusted to their merciless care over the Phlegethon,
the river of fire that flows round Hades, and
through the brazen gates that led to Torment, and their
robes were robes worn</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;With all the pomp of horror, dy&rsquo;d in gore.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Virgil.</span></p>

<p>In solemn cadence, while the thousands of beholders
watched and listened enthralled, the Furies walked
round the theatre and sang their song of terror:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg&nbsp;195]</a></span>
&ldquo;Woe! woe! to him whose hands are soiled with
blood! The darkness shall not hide him, nor shall his
dread secret lie hidden even in the bowels of the earth!
He shall not seek by flight to escape us, for vengeance
is ours, and swifter than a hawk that strikes its quarry
shall we strike. Unwearying we pursue, nor are our
swift feet and our avenging arms made slow by pity.
Woe! woe! to the shedder of innocent blood, for nor
peace nor rest is his until we have hurried his tormented
soul down to torture that shall endure everlastingly!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the listeners heard the dirge of doom, there were
none who did not think of Ibycus, the gentle-hearted
poet, so much beloved and so foully done to death, and
in the tensity of the moment when the voices ceased, a
great thrill passed over the multitudes as a voice, shrill
with amazed horror, burst from one of the uppermost
benches:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>See there! see there! behold, comrade, the cranes of
Ibycus!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Every eye looked upwards, and, harshly crying,
there passed overhead the flock of cranes to whom the
poet had entrusted his dying message. Then, like an
electric shock, there came to all those who beheld the
knowledge that he who had cried aloud was the murderer
of Ibycus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seize him! seize him!&rdquo; cried in unison the
voices of thousands. &ldquo;Seize the man, and him to whom
he spoke!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frantically the trembling wretch tried to deny his
words, but it was too late. The roar of the multitudes
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg&nbsp;196]</a></span>
was as that of an angry sea that hungers for its prey
and will not be denied. He who had spoken and him
to whom he spoke were seized by a score of eager
hands.</p>

<p>In white-faced terror, because the Furies had hunted
them down, they made confession of their crime and
were put to death. And the flock of grey-plumaged,
rosy-headed cranes winged their way on to the marshes,
there to beck and bow to each other, and to dance in the
golden sunset, well content because their message was
delivered, and Ibycus, the poet-musician who had given
them welcome, was avenged.</p>

<h2>SYRINX</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Is it because the wild-wood passion still lingers in our hearts,
because still in our minds the voice of Syrinx lingers in melancholy
music, the music of regret and longing, that for most of us there is
so potent a spell in running waters?&rdquo;</p></div>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Fiona Macleod.</span></p>


<p>As the evening shadows lengthen, and the night wind
softly steals through the trees, touching with restless
fingers the still waters of the little lochans that would
fain have rest, there can be heard a long, long whisper,
like a sigh. There is no softer, sadder note to be heard
in all Pan&rsquo;s great orchestra, nor can one marvel that it
should be so, for the whisper comes from the reeds who
gently sway their heads while the wind passes over them
as they grow by lonely lake or river.</p>

<p>This is the story of Syrinx, the reed, as Ovid has told
it to us.</p>

<p>In Arcadia there dwelt a nymph whose name was
Syrinx. So fair she was that for her dear sake fauns
and satyrs forgot to gambol, and sat in the green woods
in thoughtful stillness, that they might see her as she
passed. But for none of them had Syrinx a word of
kindness. She had no wish for love.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;But as for Love, truly I know him not,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have passionately turned my lips therefrom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from that fate the careless gods allot.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Lady Margaret Sackville.</span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg&nbsp;198]</a></span>
To one only of the gods did she give her loyal allegiance.
She worshipped Diana, and with her followed
the chase. As she lightly sped through the forest she
might have been Diana herself, and there were those
who said they would not know nymph from goddess,
but that the goddess carried a silver bow, while that of
Syrinx was made of horn. Fearless, and without a care
or sorrow, Syrinx passed her happy days. Not for all
the gold of Midas would she have changed places with
those love-lorn nymphs who sighed their hearts out for
love of a god or of a man. Heartwhole, fancy free, gay
and happy and lithe and strong, as a young boy whose
joy it is to run and to excel in the chase, was Syrinx,
whose white arms against the greenwood trees dazzled
the eyes of the watching fauns when she drew back her
bow to speed an arrow at the stag she had hunted since
early dawn. Each morning that she awoke was the
morning of a day of joy; each night that she lay down
to rest, it was to sleep as a child who smiles in his sleep
at the remembrance of a perfect day.</p>

<p>But to Syrinx, who knew no fear, Fear came at last.
She was returning one evening from the shadowy hills,
untired by the chase that had lasted for many an hour,
when, face to face, she met with one whom hitherto she
had only seen from afar. Of him the other nymphs spoke
often. Who was so great as Pan?&mdash;Pan, who ruled the
woods. None could stand against Pan. Those who defied
him must ever come under his power in the end. He
was Fear; he was Youth; he was Joy; he was Love; he
was Beast; he was Power; he was Man; he was God.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg&nbsp;199]</a></span>
He was Life itself. So did they talk, and Syrinx listened
with a smile. Not Pan himself could bring Fear to her.</p>

<p>Yet when he met her in the silent loneliness of a
great forest and stood in her path and gazed on her with
eyes of joyous amazement that one so fair should be in
his kingdom without his having had knowledge of it,
Syrinx felt something come to her heart that never
before had assailed it.</p>

<p>Pan&rsquo;s head was crowned with sharp pine-leaves. His
face was young and beautiful, and yet older than the
mountains and the seas. Sadness and joy were in his
eyes at the same time, and at the same moment there
looked out from them unutterable tenderness and merciless
cruelty. For only a little space of time did he stand
and hold her eyes with his own, and then in low caressing
voice he spoke, and his words were like the song of a
bird to his mate, like the call of the earth to the sun in
spring, like the lap of the waves when they tell the rocks
of their eternal longing. Of love he spoke, of love that
demanded love, and of the nymph&rsquo;s most perfect beauty.
Yet as he spoke, the unknown thing came and smote
with icy hands the heart of Syrinx.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! I have Fear! I have Fear!&rdquo; she cried, and
more cruel grew the cruelty in the eyes of Pan, but his
words were still the words of passionate tenderness.
Like a bird that trembles, helpless, before the serpent
that would slay it, so did Syrinx the huntress stand, and
her face in the shade of the forest was like a white lily in
the night. But when the god would have drawn her
close to him and kissed her red lips, Fear leapt to Terror,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg&nbsp;200]</a></span>
and Terror winged her feet. Never in the chase with
Diana had she run as now she ran. But like a rushing
storm did Pan pursue her, and when he laughed she
knew that what the nymphs had said was true&mdash;he was
Power&mdash;he was Fear&mdash;he was Beast&mdash;he was Life itself.
The darkness of the forest swiftly grew more dark. The
climbing trails of ivy and the fragrant creeping plants
caught her flying feet and made her stumble. Branches
and twigs grew alive and snatched at her and baulked
her as she passed. Trees blocked her path. All Nature
had grown cruel, and everywhere there seemed to her
to be a murmur of mocking laughter, laughter from the
creatures of Pan, echoing the merciless merriment of
their lord and master. Nearer he came, ever nearer.
Almost she could feel his breath on her neck; but
even as he stretched out his arms to seize the nymph
whose breath came with sobs like that of a young
doe spent by the chase, they reached the brink of
the river Ladon. And to her &ldquo;watery sisters&rdquo; the
nymphs of the river, Syrinx breathed a desperate prayer
for pity and for help, then stumbled forward, a quarry
run to the death.</p>

<p>With an exultant shout, Pan grasped her as she fell.
And lo, in his arms he held no exquisite body with
fiercely beating heart, but a clump of slender reeds.
Baffled he stood for a little space, and, as he stood, the
savagery of the beast faded from his eyes that were
fathomless as dark mountain tarns where the sun-rays
seldom come, and there came into them a man&rsquo;s
unutterable woe. At the reeds by the river he gazed,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg&nbsp;201]</a></span>
and sighed a great sigh, the sigh that comes from the
heart of a god who thinks of the pain of the world. Like
a gentle zephyr the sigh breathed through the reeds,
and from the reeds there came a sound as of the sobbing
sorrow of the world&rsquo;s desire. Then Pan drew his sharp
knife, and with it he cut seven of the reeds that grew
by the murmuring river.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thus shalt thou still be mine, my Syrinx,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Deftly he bound them together, cut them into unequal
lengths, and fashioned for himself an instrument,
that to this day is called the Syrinx, or Pan&rsquo;s Pipes.</p>

<p>So did the god make music.</p>

<p>And all that night he sat by the swift-flowing river,
and the music from his pipe of reeds was so sweet and
yet so passing sad, that it seemed as though the very
heart of the earth itself were telling of its sadness. Thus
Syrinx still lives&mdash;still dies:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;A note of music by its own breath slain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blown tenderly from the frail heart of a reed,&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>and as the evening light comes down on silent places
and the trembling shadows fall on the water, we can
hear her mournful whisper through the swaying reeds,
brown and silvery-golden, that grow by lonely lochan
and lake and river.</p>

<h2>THE DEATH OF ADONIS</h2>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;The fairest youth that ever maiden&rsquo;s dream conceived.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Lewis Morris.</span></p>


<p>The ideally beautiful woman, a subject throughout the
centuries for all the greatest powers of sculptor&rsquo;s and
painter&rsquo;s art, is Venus, or Aphrodite, goddess of beauty
and of love. And he who shares with her an unending
supremacy of perfection of form is not one of the gods,
her equals, but a mortal lad, who was the son of a king.</p>

<p>As Aphrodite sported one day with Eros, the little god
of love, by accident she wounded herself with one of his
arrows. And straightway there came into her heart a
strange longing and an ache such as the mortal victims
of the bow of Eros knew well. While still the ache
remained, she heard, in a forest of Cyprus, the baying
of hounds and the shouts of those who urged them on in
the chase. For her the chase possessed no charms, and
she stood aside while the quarry burst through the
branches and thick undergrowth of the wood, and the
hounds followed in hot pursuit. But she drew her
breath sharply, and her eyes opened wide in amazed
gladness, when she looked on the perfect beauty of the
fleet-footed hunter, who was only a little less swift than
the shining spear that sped from his hand with the sureness
of a bolt from the hand of Zeus. And she knew
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg&nbsp;203]</a></span>
that this must be none other than Adonis, son of the
king of Paphos, of whose matchless beauty she had
heard not only the dwellers on earth, but the Olympians
themselves speak in wonder. While gods and men were
ready to pay homage to his marvellous loveliness, to
Adonis himself it counted for nothing. But in the
vigour of his perfect frame he rejoiced; in his fleetness
of foot, in the power of that arm that Michael Angelo
has modelled, in the quickness and sureness of his aim,
for the boy was a mighty hunter with a passion for the
chase.</p>

<p>Aphrodite felt that her heart was no longer her own,
and knew that the wound that the arrow of Eros had
dealt would never heal until she knew that Adonis loved
her. No longer was she to be found by the Cytherian
shores or in those places once held by her most dear,
and the other gods smiled when they beheld her vying
with Diana in the chase and following Adonis as he
pursued the roe, the wolf, and the wild boar through the
dark forest and up the mountain side. The pride of the
goddess of love must often have hung its head. For
her love was a thing that Adonis could not understand.
He held her &ldquo;Something better than his dog, a little
dearer than his horse,&rdquo; and wondered at her whim to
follow his hounds through brake and marsh and lonely
forest. His reckless courage was her pride and her
torture. Because he was to her so infinitely dear, his
path seemed ever bestrewn with dangers. But when
she spoke to him with anxious warning and begged him
to beware of the fierce beasts that might one day turn
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg&nbsp;204]</a></span>
on him and bring him death, the boy laughed mockingly
and with scorn.</p>

<p>There came at last a day when she asked him what
he did on the morrow, and Adonis told her with sparkling
eyes that had no heed for her beauty, that he had word
of a wild boar, larger, older, more fierce than any he
had ever slain, and which, before the chariot of Diana
next passed over the land of Cyprus, would be lying
dead with a spear-wound through it.</p>

<p>With terrible foreboding, Aphrodite tried to dissuade
him from his venture.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;O, be advised: thou know&rsquo;st not what it is<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With javelin&rsquo;s point a churlish swine to gore,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Whose full perfection all the world amazes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But having thee at vantage&mdash;wondrous dread!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would root these beauties as he roots the mead.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Shakespeare.</span></p>

<p>To all her warnings, Adonis would but give smiles.
Ill would it become him to slink abashed away before
the fierceness of an old monster of the woods, and,
laughing in the pride of a whole-hearted boy at a woman&rsquo;s
idle fears, he sped homewards with his hounds.</p>

<p>With the gnawing dread of a mortal woman in her
soul, Aphrodite spent the next hours. Early she sought
the forest that she might again plead with Adonis, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg&nbsp;205]</a></span>
maybe persuade him, for love of her, to give up the
perilous chase because she loved him so.</p>

<p>But even as the rosy gates of the Dawn were opening,
Adonis had begun his hunt, and from afar off the goddess
could hear the baying of his hounds. Yet surely their
clamour was not that of hounds in full cry, nor was it the
triumphant noise that they so fiercely make as they pull
down their vanquished quarry, but rather was it baying,
mournful as that of the hounds of Hecate. Swift as a
great bird, Aphrodite reached the spot from whence
came the sound that made her tremble.</p>

<p>Amidst the trampled brake, where many a hound lay
stiff and dead, while others, disembowelled by the tusks
of the boar, howled aloud in mortal agony, lay Adonis.
As he lay, he &ldquo;knew the strange, slow chill which,
stealing, tells the young that it is death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And as, <i>in extremis</i>, he thought of past things, manhood
came to Adonis and he knew something of the
meaning of the love of Aphrodite&mdash;a love stronger than
life, than time, than death itself. His hounds and his
spear seemed but playthings now. Only the eternities
remained&mdash;bright Life, and black-robed Death.</p>

<p>Very still he lay, as though he slept; marble-white,
and beautiful as a statue wrought by the hand of a god.
But from the cruel wound in the white thigh, ripped
open by the boar&rsquo;s profaning tusk, the red blood dripped,
in rhythmic flow, crimsoning the green moss under him.
With a moan of unutterable anguish, Aphrodite threw
herself beside him, and pillowed his dear head in her
tender arms. Then, for a little while, life&rsquo;s embers
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg&nbsp;206]</a></span>
flickered up, his cold lips tried to form themselves into
a smile of understanding and held themselves up to hers.
And, while they kissed, the soul of Adonis passed away.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;A cruel, cruel wound on his thigh hath Adonis, but a deeper wound
in her heart doth Cytherea<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> bear. About him his dear hounds are
loudly baying, and the nymphs of the wild woods wail him; but
Aphrodite with unbound locks through the glades goes wandering&mdash;wretched,
with hair unbraided, with feet unsandalled, and the thorns as
she passes wound her and pluck the blossom of her sacred blood.
Shrill she wails as down the woodland she is borne.... And the rivers
bewail the sorrows of Aphrodite, and the wells are weeping Adonis on
the mountains. The flowers flush red for anguish, and Cytherea through
all the mountain-knees, through every dell doth utter piteous dirge:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<em>Woe, woe for Cytherea, he hath perished, the lovely Adonis!</em>&rsquo;&rdquo;</p></div>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Bion.</span></p>

<p>Passionately the god besought Zeus to give her back
her lost love, and when there was no answer to her
prayers, she cried in bitterness: &ldquo;Yet shall I keep a
memorial of Adonis that shall be to all everlasting!&rdquo;
And, as she spoke, her tears and his blood, mingling
together, were turned into flowers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A tear the Paphian sheds for each blood-drop of
Adonis, and tears and blood on the earth are turned to
flowers. The blood brings forth the roses, the tears, the
wind-flower.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yet, even then, the grief of Aphrodite knew no
abatement. And when Zeus, wearied with her crying,
heard her, to his amazement, beg to be allowed to go
down to the Shades that she might there endure eternal
twilight with the one of her heart, his soul was softened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never can it be that the Queen of Love and of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg&nbsp;207]</a></span>
Beauty leaves Olympus and the pleasant earth to tread
for evermore the dark Cocytus valley,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Nay,
rather shall I permit the beauteous youth of thy love to
return for half of each year from the Underworld that
thou and he may together know the joy of a love that
hath reached fruition.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus did it come to pass that when dark winter&rsquo;s
gloom was past, Adonis returned to the earth and to the
arms of her who loved him.</p>

Were we to take the whole of that immense construction
of fable that was once the religion of Greece, and treat it
as a vast play in which there were many thousands of
actors, we should find that one of these actors appeared
again and again. In one scene, then in another, in connection
with one character, then with another, unexpectedly
slipping out from the shadows of the trees from
the first act even to the last, we should see Pan&mdash;so young
and yet so old, so heedlessly gay, yet so infinitely sad.</p>

<p>If, rather, we were to regard the mythology of
Greece as a colossal and wonderful piece of music, where
the thunders of Jupiter and the harsh hoof-beats of the
fierce black steeds of Pluto, the king whose coming none
can stay, made way for the limpid melodies of Orpheus
and the rustling whisper of the footfall of nymphs and
of fauns on the leaves, through it all we should have an
ever-recurring <i>motif</i>&mdash;the clear, magical fluting of the
pipes of Pan.</p>

<p>We have the stories of Pan and of Echo, of Pan and
of Midas, of Pan and Syrinx, of Pan and Selene, of Pan and
Pitys, of Pan and Pomona. Pan it was who taught Apollo
how to make music. It was Pan who spoke what he
deemed to be comfort to the distraught Psyche; Pan who
gave Diana her hounds. The other gods had their own
special parts in the great play that at one time would
have Olympus for stage, at another the earth. Pan was
Nature incarnate. He was the Earth itself.</p>

<p>Many are the stories of his genealogy, but the one
that is given in one of the Homeric hymns is that Hermes,
the swift-footed young god, wedded Dryope, the beautiful
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg&nbsp;211]</a></span>
daughter of a shepherd in Arcadia, and to them was
born, under the greenwood tree, the infant, Pan. When
Dryope first looked on her child, she was smitten with
horror, and fled away from him. The deserted baby
roared lustily, and when his father, Hermes, examined
him he found a rosy-cheeked thing with prick ears and
tiny horns that grew amongst his thick curls, and with
the dappled furry chest of a faun, while instead of
dimpled baby legs he had the strong, hairy hind legs of
a goat. He was a fearless creature, and merry withal,
and when Hermes had wrapped him up in a hare skin,
he sped to Olympus and showed his fellow-gods the son
that had been born to him and the beautiful nymph of
the forest. Baby though he was, Pan made the Olympians
laugh. He had only made a woman, his own
mother, cry; all others rejoiced at the new creature that
had come to increase their merriment. And Bacchus,
who loved him most of all, and felt that here was a babe
after his own heart, bestowed on him the name by which
he was forever known&mdash;Pan, meaning <em>All</em>.</p>

<p>Thus Pan grew up, the earthly equal of the Olympians,
and, as he grew, he took to himself the lordship of
woods and of solitary places. He was king of huntsmen
and of fishermen, lord of flocks and herds and of all the
wild creatures of the forest. All living, soulless things
owned him their master; even the wild bees claimed
him as their overlord. He was ever merry, and when a
riot of music and of laughter slew the stillness of the
shadowy woods, it was Pan who led the dancing throng
of white-limbed nymphs and gambolling satyrs, for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg&nbsp;212]</a></span>
whom he made melody from the pipes for whose creation
a maid had perished.</p>

<p>Round his horns and thick curls he presently came to
wear a crown of sharp pine-leaves, remembrance of another
fair nymph whose destruction he had brought about.</p>

<p>Pitys listened to the music of Pan, and followed him
even as the children followed the Pied Piper of later
story. And ever his playing lured her further on and
into more dangerous and desolate places, until at length
she stood on the edge of a high cliff whose pitiless front
rushed sheer down to cruel rocks far below. There
Pan&rsquo;s music ceased, and Pitys knew all the joy and the
sorrow of the world as the god held out his arms to
embrace her. But neither Pan nor Pitys had remembrance
of Boreas, the merciless north wind, whose love
the nymph had flouted.</p>

<p>Ere Pan could touch her, a blast, fierce and strong as
death, had seized the nymph&rsquo;s fragile body, and as a
wind of March tears from the tree the first white blossom
that has dared to brave the ruthless gales, and casts it,
torn and dying, to the earth, so did Boreas grip the
slender Pitys and dash her life out on the rocks far
down below. From her body sprang the pine tree,
slender, erect, clinging for dear life to the sides of precipices,
and by the prickly wreath he always wore, Pan
showed that he held her in fond remembrance.</p>

<p>Joy, and youth, and force, and spring, was Pan to all
the creatures whose overlord he was. Pan meant the
richness of the sap in the trees, the lushness of grass
and of the green stems of the blue hyacinths and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg&nbsp;213]</a></span>
golden daffodils; the throbbing of growth in the woodland
and in the meadows; the trilling of birds that seek
for their mates and find them; the coo of the doves on
their nests of young; the arrogant virility of bulls and
of stags whose lowing and belling wake the silence of
the hills; the lightness of heart that made the nymphs
dance and sing, the fauns leap high, and shout aloud
for very joy of living. All of these things was Pan to
those of his own kingdom.</p>

<p>Yet to the human men and women who had also
listened to his playing, Pan did not mean only joyousness.
He was to them a force that many times became a terror
because of its sheer irresistibleness.</p>

<p>While the sun shone and the herdsmen could see the
nodding white cotton-grass, the asphodel, and the golden
kingcups that hid the black death-traps of the pitiless
marshes, they had no fear of Pan. Nor in the daytime,
when in the woods the sunbeams played amongst
the trees and the birds sang of Spring and of love,
and the syrinx sent an echo from far away that
made the little silver birches give a whispering laugh of
gladness and the pines cease to sigh, did man or maid
have any fear. Yet when darkness fell on the land,
terror would come with it, and, deep in their hearts,
they would know that the terror was Pan. Blindly,
madly, they would flee from something that they could
not see, something they could barely hear, and many
times rush to their own destruction. And there would
be no sweet sound of music then, only mocking laughter.
<em>Panic</em> was the name given to this fear&mdash;the name by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg&nbsp;214]</a></span>
which it still is known. And, to this day, panic yet
comes, and not only by night, but only in very lonely
places. There are those who have known it, and for
shame have scarce dared to own it, in highland glens,
in the loneliness of an island in the western sea, in a
green valley amongst the &ldquo;solemn, kindly, round-backed
hills&rdquo; of the Scottish Border, in the remoteness
of the Australian bush. They have no reasons to give&mdash;or
their reasons are far-fetched. Only, to them as to
Mowgli, <em>Fear</em> came, and the fear seemed to them to
come from a malignant something from which they
must make all haste to flee, did they value safety of
mind and of body. Was it for this reason that the
Roman legionaries on the Great Wall so often reared
altars in that lonely land of moor and mountain where
so many of them fought and died&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;<i>To Pan, and to the Sylvan deities</i>&rdquo;?<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>For surely Pan was there, where the curlew cried and
the pewit mourned, and sometimes the waiting soldiers
must almost have imagined his mocking laughter borne
in the winds that swept across the bleak hills of their
exiled solitude.</p>

<p>He who was surely one of the bravest of mankind,
one who always, in his own words, &ldquo;clung to his
paddle,&rdquo; writes of such a fear when he escaped death
by drowning from the Oise in flood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The devouring element in the universe had leaped
out against me, in this green valley quickened by a running
stream. The bells were all very pretty in their
way, but I had heard some of the hollow notes of Pan&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg&nbsp;215]</a></span>
music. Would the wicked river drag me down by the
heels, indeed? and look so beautiful all the time?
Nature&rsquo;s good humour was only skin-deep, after all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And of the reeds he writes: &ldquo;Pan once played upon
their forefathers; and so, by the hands of his river, he
still plays upon these later generations down all the valley
of the Oise; and plays the same air, both sweet and
shrill, to tell us of the beauty and the terror of the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>The Beauty and the terror of the world</em>&rdquo;&mdash;was not
this what Pan stood for to the Greeks of long ago?</p>

<p>The gladness of living, the terror of living&mdash;the exquisite
joy and the infinite pain&mdash;that has been the
possession of Pan&mdash;for we have not yet found a more
fitting title&mdash;since ever time began. And because Pan
is as he is, from him has evolved a higher Pantheism.
We have done away with his goat&rsquo;s feet and his horns,
although these were handed on from him to Satan when
Christianity broke down the altars of Paganism.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nature, which is the Time-vesture of God and reveals
Him to the wise, hides Him from the foolish,&rdquo; writes
Carlyle. Pan is Nature, and Nature is not the ugly thing
that the Calvinists would once have had us believe it to be.
Nature is capable of being made the garment of God.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Tennyson.</span></p>

<p>Carlyle says that &ldquo;The whole universe is the Garment
of God,&rdquo; and he who lives very close to Nature
must, at least once in a lifetime, come, in the solitude of
the lonely mountain tops, upon that bush that burns and
is not yet consumed, and out of the midst of which
speaks the voice of the Eternal.</p>

<p>The immortal soul&mdash;the human body&mdash;united, yet
ever in conflict&mdash;that is Pan. The sighing and longing
for things that must endure everlastingly&mdash;the riotous
enjoyment of the beauty of life&mdash;the perfect appreciation
of the things that are. Life is so real, so strong, so full
of joyousness and of beauty,&mdash;and on the other side of a
dark stream, cold, menacing, cruel, stands Death. Yet
Life and Death make up the sum of existence, and until
we, who live our paltry little lives here on earth in the
hope of a Beyond, can realise what is the true air that is
played on those pipes of Pan, there is no hope for us of
even a vague comprehension of the illimitable Immortality.</p>

<p>It is a very old tale that tells us of the passing of
Pan. In the reign of Tiberius, on that day when, on
the hill of Calvary, at Jerusalem in Syria, Jesus Christ
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg&nbsp;217]</a></span>
died as a malefactor, on the cross&mdash;&ldquo;And it was about
the sixth hour, and there was a darkness all over the
earth&rdquo;&mdash;Thamus, an Egyptian pilot, was guiding a ship
near the islands of Pax&aelig; in the Ionian Sea; and to him
came a great voice, saying, &ldquo;Go! make everywhere the
proclamation, <em>Great Pan is dead!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>And from the poop of his ship, when, in great heaviness
of heart, because for him the joy of the world seemed
to have passed away, Thamus had reached Palodes, he
shouted aloud the words that he had been told. Then,
from all the earth there arose a sound of great lamentation,
and the sea and the trees, the hills, and all the
creatures of Pan sighed in sobbing unison an echo of
the pilot&rsquo;s words&mdash;&ldquo;<em>Pan is dead&mdash;Pan is dead.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pan is dead. In the old Hellenistic sense Pan is
gone forever. Yet until Nature has ceased to be, the
thing we call Pan must remain a living entity. Some
there be who call his music, when he makes all humanity
dance to his piping, &ldquo;<i>Joie de vivre</i>,&rdquo; and De Musset
speaks of &ldquo;<i>Le vin de la jeunesse</i>&rdquo; which ferments &ldquo;<i>dans
les veines de Dieu</i>.&rdquo; It is Pan who inspires Seumas, the
old islander, of whom Fiona Macleod writes, and who,
looking towards the sea at sunrise, says, &ldquo;Every
morning like this I take my hat off to the beauty of the
world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Half of the flesh and half of the spirit is Pan.
There are some who have never come into contact with
him, who know him only as the emblem of Paganism, a
cruel thing, more beast than man, trampling, with goat&rsquo;s
feet, on the gentlest flowers of spring. They know not
the meaning of &ldquo;the Green Fire of Life,&rdquo; nor have they
ever known Pan&rsquo;s moods of tender sadness. Never to
them has come in the forest, where the great grey trunks
of the beeches rise from a carpet of primroses and blue
hyacinths, and the slender silver beeches are the guardian
angels of the starry wood-anemones, and the sunbeams
slant through the oak and beech leaves of tender
green and play on the dead amber leaves of a year that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg&nbsp;219]</a></span>
is gone, the whisper of little feet that cannot be seen, the
piercing sweet music from very far away, that fills the
heart with gladness and yet with a strange pain&mdash;the
ache of the <i>Weltschmerz</i>&mdash;the echo of the pipes of Pan.</p>

<p>In every land, North and South, East and West, from
sea to sea, myth and legend hand down to us as cruel and
malignant creatures, who ceaselessly seek to slay man&rsquo;s
body and to destroy his soul, the half-human children
of the restless sea and of the fiercely running streams.</p>

<p>In Scotland and in Australia, in every part of
Europe, we have tales of horrible formless things which
frequent lonely rivers and lochs and marshes, and
to meet which must mean Death. And equal in malignity
with them, and infinitely more dangerous, are the
beautiful beings who would seem to claim descent from
Lilith, the soulless wife of Adam.</p>

<p>Such were the sirens who would have compassed the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg&nbsp;221]</a></span>
destruction of Odysseus. Such are the mermaids, to wed
with one of whom must bring unutterable woe upon any
of the sons of men. In lonely far-off places by the sea
there still are tales of exquisite melodies heard in the
gloaming, or at night when the moon makes a silver
pathway across the water; still are there stories of
women whose home is in the depths of the ocean, and
who come to charm away men&rsquo;s souls by their beauty
and by their pitiful longing for human love.</p>

<p>Those who have looked on the yellow-green waters
of the Seine, or who have seen the more turbid, more
powerful Thames sweeping her serious, majestic way
down towards the open ocean, at Westminster, or at
London Bridge, can perhaps realise something of that
inwardness of things that made the people of the past,
and that makes the mentally uncontrolled people of the
present, feel a fateful power calling upon them to listen
to the insistence of the exacting waters, and to surrender
their lives and their souls forever to a thing that called
and which would brook no denial. In the Morgue, or
in a mortuary by the river-side, their poor bodies have
lain when the rivers have worked their will with them,
and &ldquo;Suicide,&rdquo; &ldquo;Death by drowning,&rdquo; or &ldquo;By Misadventure&rdquo;
have been the verdicts given. We live in
a too practical, too utterly common-sensical age to
conceive a poor woman with nothing on earth left to
live for, being lured down to the Shades by a creature
of the water, or a man who longs for death seeing a
beautiful daughter of a river-god beckoning to him to
come where he will find peace everlasting.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg&nbsp;222]</a></span>
Yet ever we war with the sea. All of us know her
seductive charm, but all of us fear her. The boundary
line between our fear of the fierce, remorseless, ever-seeking,
cruel waves that lap up life swiftly as a thirsty
beast laps water, and the old belief in cruel sea-creatures
that sought constantly for the human things that were to
be their prey, is a very narrow one. And once we have
seen the sea in a rage, flinging herself in terrible anger
against the poor, frail toy that the hands of men have
made and that was intended to rule and to resist her,
foaming and frothing over the decks of the thing that
carries human lives, we can understand much of the old
pagan belief. If one has watched a river in spate, red
as with blood, rushing triumphantly over all resistance,
smashing down the trees that baulk it, sweeping away each
poor, helpless thing, brute or human, that it encounters,
dealing out ruin and death, and proceeding superbly on
to carry its trophies of disaster to the bosom of the
Ocean Mother, very easy is it to see from whence came
those old tales of cruelty, of irresistible strength, of
desire.</p>

<p>Many are the tales of sea-maidens who have stolen
men&rsquo;s lives from them and sent their bodies to move
up and down amidst the wrack, like broken toys with
which a child has grown tired of playing and cast
away in weariness. In an eighth-century chronicle concerning
St. Fechin, we read of evil powers whose rage
is &ldquo;seen in that watery fury and their hellish hate and
turbulence in the beating of the sea against the rocks.&rdquo;
&ldquo;The bitter gifts of our lord Poseidon&rdquo; is the name
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg&nbsp;223]</a></span>
given to them by one of the earliest poets of Greece<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
and a poet of our own time&mdash;poet of the sea, of running
water, and of lonely places&mdash;quotes from the saying of
a fisherman of the isle of Ulva words that show why
simple minds have so many times materialised the restless,
devouring element into the form of a woman who
is very beautiful, but whose tender mercies are very
cruel. &ldquo;She is like a woman of the old tales whose
beauty is dreadful,&rdquo; said Seumas, the islander, &ldquo;and
who breaks your heart at last whether she smiles or
frowns. But she doesn&rsquo;t care about that, or whether
you are hurt or not. It&rsquo;s because she has no heart,
being all a wild water.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>Treacherous, beautiful, remorseless, that is how men
regard the sea and the rushing rivers, of whom the
sirens and mermaids of old tradition have come to
stand as symbols. Treacherous and pitiless, yet with a
fascination that can draw even the moon and the stars
to her breast:</p>

<p>Very many are the stories of the women of the sea
and of the rivers, but that one who must forever hold
her own, because Heine has immortalised her in song,
is the river maiden of the Rhine&mdash;the Lorelei.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg&nbsp;224]</a></span>
Near St. Goar, there rises out of the waters of the
Rhine a perpendicular rock, some four hundred feet high.
Many a boatman in bygone days there met his death,
and the echo which it possesses is still a mournful one.
Those who know the great river, under which lies hid
the treasure of the Nibelungs, with its &ldquo;gleaming towns
by the river-side and the green vineyards combed along
the hills,&rdquo; and who have felt the romance of the rugged
crags, crowned by ruined castles, that stand like fantastic
and very ancient sentries to guard its channel, can well
understand how easy of belief was the legend of the
Lorelei.</p>

<p>Down the green waters came the boatman&rsquo;s frail
craft, ever drawing nearer to the perilous rock. All his
care and all his skill were required to avert a very visible
danger. But high above him, from the rock round
which the swirling eddies splashed and foamed, there
came a voice.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Her voice was like the voice the stars<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had when they sang together.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>And when the boatman looked up at the sound of
such sweet music, he beheld a maiden more fair than any
he had ever dreamed of. On the rock she sat, combing
her long golden hair with a comb of red gold. Her limbs
were white as foam and her eyes green like the emerald
green of the rushing river. And her red lips smiled on
him and her arms were held out to him in welcome, and
the sound of her song thrilled through the heart of him
who listened, and her eyes drew his soul to her arms.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg&nbsp;225]</a></span>
Forgotten was all peril. The rushing stream seized the
little boat and did with it as it willed. And while the
boatman still gazed upwards, intoxicated by her matchless
beauty and the magic of her voice, his boat was
swept against the rock, and, with the jar and crash,
knowledge came back to him, and he heard, with broken
heart, the mocking laughter of the Lorelei as he was
dragged down as if by a thousand icy hands, and, with
a choking sigh, surrendered his life to the pitiless river.</p>

<p>To one man only was it granted to see the siren so
near that he could hold her little, cold, white hands,
and feel the wondrous golden hair sweep across his
eyes. This was a young fisherman, who met her by
the river and listened to the entrancing songs that she
sang for him alone. Each evening she would tell him
where to cast his nets on the morrow, and he prospered
greatly and was a marvel to all others who fished in
the waters of the Rhine. But there came an evening
when he was seen joyously hastening down the river
bank in response to the voice of the Lorelei, that surely
never had sounded so honey-sweet before, and he came
back nevermore. They said that the Lorelei had
dragged him down to her coral caves that he might live
with her there forever, and, if it were not so, the rushing
water could never whisper her secret and theirs, of
a lifeless plaything that they swept seawards, and that
wore a look of horror and of great wonder in its dead,
wide-open eyes.</p>

<p>It is &ldquo;ein M&auml;rchen aus alten Zeiten&rdquo;&mdash;a legend of
long ago.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg&nbsp;226]</a></span>
But it is a very much older <i>M&auml;rchen</i> that tells us of
the warning of Circe to Odysseus:</p>

<p>&ldquo;To the Sirens first shalt thou come, who bewitch
all men, whosoever shall come to them. Whoso draws
nigh them unwittingly and hears the sound of the Siren&rsquo;s
voice, never doth he see wife or babes stand by him on
his return, nor have they joy at his coming; but the
Sirens enchant him with their clear song.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And until there shall be no more sea and the rivers
have ceased to run, the enchantment that comes from
the call of the water to the hearts of men must go on.
Day by day the toll of lives is paid, and still the cruel
daughters of the deep remain unsatisfied. We can hear
their hungry whimper from the rushing river through
the night, and the waves of the sea that thunders along
the coast would seem to voice the insistence of their
desire. And we who listen to their ceaseless, restless
moan can say with Heine:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;<i>Ich weiss nicht, was soll es bedeuten,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Dass ich so traurig bin.</i>&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>For the sadness of heart, the melancholy that their
music brings us is a mystery which none on this earth
may ever unravel.</p>

<h2>FREYA, QUEEN OF THE NORTHERN GODS</h2>


<p>&ldquo;Friday&rsquo;s bairn is loving and giving,&rdquo; says the old
rhyme that sets forth the special qualities of the children
born on each day of the week, and to the superstitious
who regard Friday as a day of evil omen, it seems
strange that Friday&rsquo;s bairn should be so blessed. But
they forget that before Christianity swept paganism
before it, and taught those who worshipped the northern
gods the story of that first black &ldquo;Good Friday,&rdquo; the
tragedy in which all humanity was involved, Friday
was the day of Freya, &ldquo;The Beloved,&rdquo; gentle protectress,
and most generous giver of all joys, delights, and
pleasures. From her, in medi&aelig;val times, the high-born
women who acted as dispensers to their lords first took
the title <i>Frouwa</i> (=Frau), and when, in its transition
stage, the old heathenism had evolved into a religion of
strong nature worship, overshadowed by fatalism, only
thinly veneered by Christianity, the minds of the Christian
converts of Scandinavia, like those of puzzled
children, transferred to the Virgin Mary the attributes
that had formerly been those of their &ldquo;Lady&rdquo;&mdash;Freya,
the goddess of Love.</p>

<p>Long before the Madonna was worshipped, Freya
gave her name to plants, to flowers, and even to insects,
and the child who says to the beautiful little insect,
that he finds on a leaf, &ldquo;Ladybird, ladybird, fly away
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg&nbsp;228]</a></span>
home,&rdquo; is commemorating the name of the Lady, Freya,
to whom his ancestors offered their prayers.</p>

<p>In her home in the Hall of Mists, Freya (or Frigga),
wife of Odin the All Father, sat with her golden
distaff spinning the clouds. Orion&rsquo;s Belt was known
as &ldquo;Frigga&rsquo;s spindle&rdquo; by the Norsemen, and the men
on the earth, as they watched the great cumulous masses
of snowy-white, golden or silver edged, the fleecy cloudlets
of grey, soft as the feathers on the breast of a dove,
or the angry banks of black and purple, portending a
storm, had constant proof of the diligence of their goddess.
She was the protectress of those who sailed the
seas, and the care of children as they came into the
world was also hers. Hers, too, was the happy task
of bringing together after death, lovers whom Death had
parted, and to her belonged the glorious task of going
down to the fields of battle where the slain lay strewn
like leaves in autumn and leading to Valhalla the half
of the warriors who, as heroes, had died. Her vision
enabled her to look over all the earth, and she could see
into the Future, but she held her knowledge as a profound
secret that none could prevail upon her to betray.</p>

<span class="caption">FREYA SAT SPINNING THE CLOUDS</span>
</div>

<p>Thus she came to be pictured crowned with heron
plumes, the symbol of silence&mdash;the silence of the lonely
marshes where the heron stands in mutest contemplation&mdash;a
tall, very stately, very queenly, wholly beautiful
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg&nbsp;229]</a></span>
woman, with a bunch of keys at her girdle&mdash;symbol of
her protection of the Northern housewife&mdash;sometimes
clad in snow-white robes, sometimes in robes of sombre
black. And because her care was for the anxious, weary
housewife, for the mother and her new-born babe, for the
storm-tossed mariner, fighting the billows of a hungry
sea, for those whose true and pure love had suffered
the crucifixion of death, and for the glorious dead on
the field of battle, it is very easy to see Freya as her
worshippers saw her&mdash;an ideal of perfect womanhood.</p>

<p>But the gods of the Norsemen were never wholly
gods. Always they, like the gods of Greece, endeared
themselves to humanity by possessing some little, or
big, human weakness. And Freya is none the less
lovable to the descendants of her worshippers because
she possessed the so-called &ldquo;feminine weakness&rdquo; of
love of dress. Jewels, too, she loved, and knowing
the wondrous skill of the dwarfs in fashioning exquisite
ornaments, she broke off a piece of gold from
the statue of Odin, her husband, and gave it to them
to make into a necklace&mdash;the marvellous jewelled necklace
Brisingamen, that in time to come was possessed
by Beowulf. It was so exquisite a thing that it made
her beauty twice more perfect, and Odin loved her
doubly much because of it. But when he discovered that
his statue had been tampered with, his wrath was very
great, and furiously he summoned the dwarfs&mdash;they
who dealt always with fine metal&mdash;and demanded of them
which of them had done him this grievous wrong. But
the dwarfs loved Freya, and from them he got no answer.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg&nbsp;230]</a></span>
Then he placed the statue above the temple gate,
and laboured with guile to devise runes that might give
it the power of speech, so that it might shout aloud the
name of the impious robber as the robber went by.
Freya, no longer an omnipotent goddess, but a frightened
wife, trembled before his wrath, and begged the dwarfs
to help her. And when one of them&mdash;the most hideous
of all&mdash;promised that he would prevent the statue from
speaking if Freya would but deign to smile upon him,
the queen of the gods, who had no dread of ugly
things, and whose heart was full of love and of pity,
smiled her gentle smile on the piteous little creature
who had never known looks of anything but horror
and disgust from any of the deathless gods. It was
for him a wondrous moment, and the payment was
worth Death itself. That night a deep sleep fell on the
guards of Odin&rsquo;s statue, and, while they slept, the
statue was pulled down from its pedestal and smashed
into pieces. The dwarf had fulfilled his part of the
bargain.</p>

<p>When Odin next morning discovered the sacrilege,
great was his anger, and when no inquiry could find for
him the criminal, he quitted Asgard in furious wrath.
For seven months he stayed away, and in that time the
Ice Giants invaded his realm, and all the land was
covered with a pall of snow, viciously pinched by black
frosts, chilled by clinging, deadening, impenetrable
mists. But at the end of seven dreary months Odin
returned, and with him came the blessings of light and
of sunshine, and the Ice Giants in terror fled away.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg&nbsp;231]</a></span>
Well was it for woman or for warrior to gain the
favour of Freya, the Beloved, who knew how to rule
even Odin, the All Father, himself. The Winilers who
were warring with the Vandals once sought her aid,
and gained her promise of help. From Hlidskialf, the
mighty watch-tower, highest point in Asgard, from
whence Odin and his queen could look down and behold
what was happening all the world over, amongst gods
and men, dwarfs, elves, and giants, and all creatures of
their kingdom, Freya watched the Vandals and the
Winilers making ready for the battle which was to
decide forever which people should rule the other.</p>

<p>Night was descending, but in the evening light the
two gods beheld the glitter of spears, the gleam of brass
helmets and of swords, and heard from afar the hoarse
shouts of the warriors as they made ready for the great
fight on the morrow. Knowing well that her lord favoured
the Vandals, Freya asked him to tell her which
army was to gain the victory. &ldquo;The army upon which
my eyes shall first rest when I awake at the dawning,&rdquo;
said Odin, full well knowing that his couch was so placed
that he could not fail to see the Vandals when he woke.
Well pleased with his own astuteness, he then retired
to rest, and soon sleep lay heavy on his eyelids. But,
while he slept, Freya gently moved the couch upon
which he lay, so that he must open his eyes not on the
army who had won his favour, but on the army that
owned hers. To the Winilers, she gave command to
dress up their women as men, and let them meet the gaze
of Odin in the dawning, in full battle array.</p>

<p>When the sun sent its first pale green light next
morning over grey sky and sea, Odin awoke, and gazed
from his watch-tower at the army on the beach. And,
with great amazement, &ldquo;What Longbeards are those?&rdquo;
he cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are Winilers!&rdquo; said Freya, in joyous triumph,
&ldquo;but you have given them a new name. Now
must you also give them a gift! Let it be the victory,
I pray you, dear lord of mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Odin, seeing himself outwitted and knowing
that honour bade him follow the Northern custom and
give the people he had named a gift, bestowed on the
Longbeards and their men the victory that Freya craved.
Nor was the gift of Odin one for that day alone, for
to him the <i>Langobarden</i> attributed the many victories
that led them at last to find a home in the sunny land
of Italy, where beautiful Lombardy still commemorates
by its name the stratagem of Freya, the queen.</p>

<p>With the coming of Christianity, Freya, the Beloved,
was cast out along with all the other old forgotten gods.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg&nbsp;233]</a></span>
The people who had loved and worshipped her were
taught that she was an evil thing and that to worship
her was sin. Thus she was banished to the lonely peaks
of the mountains of Norway and of Sweden and to the
Brocken in Germany, no longer a goddess to be loved,
but transformed into a malignant power, full of horror
and of wickedness. On Walpurgis Night she led the
witches&rsquo; revels on the Brocken, and the cats who were
said to draw her car while still she was regarded as a
beneficent protectress of the weak and needy, ceased
to be the gentle creatures of Freya the Good, and came
under the ban of religion as the satanic companions of
witches by habit and repute.</p>

<p>One gentle thing only was her memory allowed to
keep. When, not as an omnipotent goddess but as a
heart-broken mother, she wept the death of her dearly-loved
son, Baldur the Beautiful, the tears that she
shed were turned, as they fell, into pure gold that is
found in the beds of lonely mountain streams. And
we who claim descent from the peoples who worshipped
her&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Saxon and Norman and Dane are we&rdquo;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>can surely cleanse her memory from all the ugly impurities
of superstition and remember only the pure gold
of the fact that our warrior ancestors did not only pray
to a fierce and mighty god of battles, but to a woman
who was &ldquo;loving and giving&rdquo;&mdash;the little child&rsquo;s deification
of the mother whom it loves and who holds it very
dear.</p>

<p>Among the gods of Greece we find gods and goddesses
who do unworthy deeds, but none to act the permanent
part of villain of the play. In the mythology of the
Norsemen we have a god who is wholly treacherous
and evil, ever the villain of the piece, cunning, malicious,
vindictive, and cruel&mdash;the god Loki. And as his
foil, and his victim, we have Baldur, best of all gods,
most beautiful, most greatly beloved. Baldur was the
Galahad of the court of Odin the king, his father.</p>

<p>No impure thing was to be found in his dwelling;
none could impugn his courage, yet ever he counselled
peace, ever was gentle and infinitely wise, and his beauty
was as the beauty of the whitest of all the flowers of
the Northland, called after him <i>Baldrsbr&aacute;</i>. The god
of the Norsemen was essentially a god of battles, and we
are told by great authorities that Baldur was originally
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg&nbsp;235]</a></span>
a hero who fought on the earth, and who, in time, came
to be deified. Even if it be so, it is good to think that
a race of warriors could worship one whose chief qualities
were wisdom, purity, and love.</p>

<p>In perfect happiness, loving and beloved, Baldur
lived in Asgard with his wife Nanna, until a night when
his sleep was assailed by horrible dreams of evil omen.
In the morning he told the gods that he had dreamed
that Death, a thing till then unknown in Asgard, had
come and cruelly taken his life away. Solemnly the
gods debated how this ill happening might be averted,
and Freya, his mother, fear for her best beloved hanging
heavy over her heart, took upon herself the task of laying
under oath fire and water, iron and all other metals,
trees and shrubs, birds, beasts and creeping things, to
do no harm to Baldur. With eager haste she went from
place to place, nor did she fail to exact the oath from anything
in all nature, animate or inanimate, save one only.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A twig of mistletoe, tender and fair, grew high
above the field,&rdquo; and such a little thing it was, with its
dainty green leaves and waxen white berries, nestling for
protection under the strong arm of a great oak, that the
goddess passed it by. Assuredly no scathe could come
to Baldur the Beautiful from a creature so insignificant,
and Freya returned to Asgard well pleased with her quest.</p>

<p>Then indeed was there joy and laughter amongst
the gods, for each one tried how he might slay Baldur,
but neither sword nor stone, hammer nor battle-axe
could work him any ill.</p>

<p>Odin alone remained unsatisfied. Mounted on his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg&nbsp;236]</a></span>
eight-footed grey steed, Sleipnir, he galloped off in haste
to consult the giant prophetess Angrbotha, who was dead
and had to be followed to Niflheim, the chilly underworld
that lies far north from the world of men, and where the
sun never comes. Hel, the daughter of Loki and of
Angrbotha, was queen of this dark domain.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;There, in a bitterly cold place, she received the souls of all who
died of sickness or old age; care was her bed, hunger her dish, starvation
her knife. Her walls were high and strong, and her bolts and bars
huge; &lsquo;Half blue was her skin, and half the colour of human flesh. A
goddess easy to know, and in all things very stern and grim.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p></div>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Dasent.</span></p>

<p>In her kingdom no soul that passed away in glorious
battle was received, nor any that fought out the last of
life in a fierce combat with the angry waves of the sea.
Only those who died ingloriously were her guests.</p>

<p>When he had reached the realm of Hel, Odin found
that a feast was being prepared, and the couches were
spread, as for an honoured guest, with rich tapestry and
with gold. For many a year had Angrbotha rested there
in peace, and it was only by chanting a magic spell and
tracing those runes which have power to raise the dead
that Odin awoke her. When she raised herself, terrible
and angry from her tomb, he did not tell her that he was
the mighty father of gods and men. He only asked her
for whom the great feast was prepared, and why Hel was
spreading her couches so gorgeously. And to the father
of Baldur she revealed the secret of the future, that
Baldur was the expected guest, and that by his blind
brother Hodur his soul was to be hastened to the Shades.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg&nbsp;237]</a></span>
&ldquo;Who, then, would avenge him?&rdquo; asked the father,
great wrath in his heart. And the prophetess replied
that his death should be avenged by Vali, his youngest
brother, who should not wash his hands nor comb his
hair until he had brought the slayer of Baldur to the
funeral pyre. But yet another question Odin would
fain have answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Who</em>,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;<em>would refuse to weep at Baldur&rsquo;s
death?</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thereat the prophetess, knowing that her questioner
could be none other than Odin, for to no mortal man
could be known so much of the future, refused for
evermore to speak, and returned to the silence of her
tomb. And Odin was forced to mount his steed and
to return to his own land of warmth and pleasure.</p>

<p>On his return he found that all was well with Baldur.
Thus he tried to still his anxious heart and to forget the
feast in the chill regions of Niflheim, spread for the son
who was to him the dearest, and to laugh with those
who tried in vain to bring scathe to Baldur.</p>

<p>Only one among those who looked at those sports
and grew merry, as he whom they loved stood like a
great cliff against which the devouring waves of the
fierce North Sea beat and foam and crash in vain, had
malice in his heart as he beheld the wonder. In the
evil heart of Loki there came a desire to overthrow
the god who was beloved by all gods and by all men.
He hated him because he was pure, and the mind of
Loki was as a stream into which all the filth of the world
is discharged. He hated him because Baldur was truth
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg&nbsp;238]</a></span>
and loyalty, and he, Loki, was treachery and dishonour.
He hated him because to Loki there came never a
thought that was not full of meanness and greed and
cruelty and vice, and Baldur was indeed one <i>sans peur
et sans reproche</i>.</p>

<p>Thus Loki, taking upon himself the form of a woman,
went to Fensalir, the palace, all silver and gold, where
dwelt Freya, the mother of Baldur.</p>

<p>The goddess sat, in happy majesty, spinning the
clouds, and when Loki, apparently a gentle old woman,
passed by where she sat, and then paused and asked,
as if amazed, what were the shouts of merriment that
she heard, the smiling goddess replied:</p>

<p>&ldquo;All things on earth have sworn to me never to
injure Baldur, and all the gods use their weapons against
him in vain. Baldur is safe for evermore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All things?&rdquo; queried Loki.</p>

<p>And Freya answered, &ldquo;All things but the mistletoe.
No harm can come to him from a thing so weak
that it only lives by the lives of others.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the vicious heart of Loki grew joyous. Quickly
he went to where the mistletoe grew, cut a slender green
branch, shaped it into a point, and sought the blind god
Hodur.</p>

<p>Hodur stood aside, while the other gods merrily pursued
their sport.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why dost thou not take aim at Baldur with a
weapon that fails and so join in the laughter?&rdquo; asked
Loki.</p>

<p>And Hodur sadly made answer:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg&nbsp;239]</a></span>
&ldquo;Well dost thou know that darkness is my lot, nor
have I ought to cast at my brother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Loki placed in his hand the shaft of mistletoe
and guided his aim, and well and surely Hodur cast the
dart. He waited, then, for the merry laughter that followed
ever on the onslaught of those against him whom
none could do harm. But a great and terrible cry smote
his ears. &ldquo;<em>Baldur the Beautiful is dead! is dead!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the ground lay Baldur, a white flower cut down
by the scythe of the mower. And all through the realm
of the gods, and all through the land of the Northmen
there arose a cry of bitter lamentation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was the greatest woe that ever befell gods
and men,&rdquo; says the story.</p>

<p>The sound of terrible mourning in place of laughter
brought Freya to where</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;on the floor lay Baldur dead; and round lay thickly strewn swords,
axes, darts, and spears, which all the gods in sport had lightly thrown
at Baldur, whom no weapon pierced or clove; but in his breast stood
fixed the fatal bough of mistletoe.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Matthew Arnold.</span></p>

<p>When she saw what had befallen him, Freya&rsquo;s grief
was a grief that refused to be comforted, but when the
gods, overwhelmed with sorrow, knew not what course
to take, she quickly commanded that one should ride to
Niflheim and offer Hel a ransom if she would permit
Baldur to return to Asgard.</p>

<p>Hermoder the Nimble, another of the sons of Odin,
undertook the mission, and, mounted on his father&rsquo;s
eight-footed steed, he speedily reached the ice-cold
domain of Hel.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg&nbsp;240]</a></span>
There he found Baldur, sitting on the noblest seat
of those who feasted, ruling among the people of the
Underworld. With burning words Hermoder pled with
Hel that she would permit Baldur to return to the world
of gods and the world of men, by both of whom he was so
dearly beloved. Said Hel:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Come then! if Baldur was so dear beloved,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And this is true, and such a loss is Heaven&rsquo;s&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hear, how to Heaven may Baldur be restored.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Show me through all the world the signs of grief!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fails but one thing to grieve, here Baldur stops!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let all that lives and moves upon the earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Weep him, and all that is without life weep;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let Gods, men, brutes, beweep him; plants and stones,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So shall I know the loss was dear indeed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bend my heart, and give him back to Heaven.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Matthew Arnold.</span></p>

<p>Gladly Hermoder made answer:</p>

<p>&ldquo;All things shall weep for Baldur!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Swiftly he made his perilous return journey, and
at once, when the gods heard what Hel had said,
messengers were despatched all over the earth to beg
all things, living and dead, to weep for Baldur, and so
dear to all nature was the beautiful god, that the messengers
everywhere left behind them a track of the tears
that they caused to be shed.</p>

<p>Meantime, in Asgard, preparations were made for
Baldur&rsquo;s pyre. The longest of the pines in the forest
were cut down by the gods, and piled up in a mighty
pyre on the deck of his great ship <i>Ringhorn</i>, the largest
in the world.</p>

<p>Down to the seashore they bore the body, and laid
it on the pyre with rich gifts all round it, and the
pine trunks of the Northern forests that formed the
pyre, they covered with gorgeous tapestries and fragrant
flowers. And when they had laid him there, with all
love and gentleness, and his fair young wife, Nanna,
looked on his beautiful still face, sorrow smote her
heart so that it was broken, and she fell down dead.
Tenderly they laid her beside him, and by him, too,
they laid the bodies of his horse and his hounds,
which they slew to bear their master company in the
land whither his soul had fled; and around the pyre
they twined thorns, the emblem of sleep.</p>

<p>Yet even then they looked for his speedy return,
radiant and glad to come home to a sunlit land of
happiness. And when the messengers who were to have
brought tidings of his freedom were seen drawing near,
eagerly they crowded to hear the glad words, &ldquo;<em>All
creatures weep, and Baldur shall return!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>But with them they brought not hope, but despair.
All things, living and dead, had wept, save one only.
A giantess who sat in a dark cave had laughed them
to scorn. With devilish merriment she mocked:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Neither in life, nor yet in death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gave he me gladness.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let Hel keep her prey.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg&nbsp;242]</a></span>
Then all knew that yet a second time had Baldur
been betrayed, and that the giantess was none other
than Loki, and Loki, realising the fierce wrath of Odin
and of the other gods, fled before them, yet could not
escape his doom. And grief unspeakable was that of
gods and of men when they knew that in the chill realm
of the inglorious dead Baldur must remain until the
twilight of the gods had come, until old things had passed
away, and all things had become new.</p>

<p>Not only the gods, but the giants of the storm and
frost, and the frost elves came to behold the last of him
whom they loved. Then the pyre was set alight, and
the great vessel was launched, and glided out to sea with
its sails of flame.</p>

<div class="poem">

<span class="i0">Sinking beneath the waves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Baldur returned no more!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Yet, ere he parted from his dead son, Odin stooped
over him and whispered a word in his ear. And there
are those who say that as the gods in infinite sorrow
stood on the beach staring out to sea, darkness fell, and
only a fiery track on the waves showed whither he had
gone whose passing had robbed Asgard and the Earth of
their most beautiful thing, heavy as the weight of chill
Death&rsquo;s remorseless hand would have been their hearts,
but for the knowledge of that word. They knew that
with the death of Baldur the twilight of the gods had
begun, and that by much strife and infinite suffering down
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg&nbsp;243]</a></span>
through the ages the work of their purification and hallowing
must be wrought. But when all were fit to receive
him, and peace and happiness reigned again on earth
and in heaven, Baldur would come back. For the word
was <em>Resurrection</em>.</p>

<h2>BEOWULF</h2>

<p>Whether those who read it be scholars who would
argue about the origin and date of the poem, ingenious
theorists who would fain use all the fragmentary tales
and rhymes of the nursery as parts of a vast jig-saw
puzzle of nature myths, or merely simple folk who read
a tale for a tale&rsquo;s sake, every reader of the poem of
Beowulf must own that it is one of the finest stories
ever written.</p>

<p>It is &ldquo;the most ancient heroic poem in the Germanic
language,&rdquo; and was brought to Britain by the &ldquo;Wing&egrave;d
Hats&rdquo; who sailed across the grey North Sea to conquer
and to help to weld that great amalgam of peoples into
what is now the British Race.</p>

<p>But once it had arrived in England, the legend was
put into a dress that the British-born could more readily
appreciate. In all probability the scene of the story was
a corner of that island of Saeland upon which Copenhagen
now stands, but he who wrote down the poem for his
countrymen and who wrote it in the pure literary Anglo-Saxon
of Wessex, painted the scenery from the places
that he and his readers knew best. And if you should
walk along the breezy, magnificent, rugged Yorkshire
coast for twelve miles, from Whitby northward to the top
of Bowlby Cliff, you would find it quite easy to believe
that it was there amongst the high sea-cliffs that Beowulf
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg&nbsp;245]</a></span>
and his hearth-sharers once lived, and there, on the highest
ness of our eastern coast, under a great barrow, that
Beowulf was buried. <i>Beowulfesby</i>&mdash;<i>Bowlby</i> seems a
quite easy transition. But the people of our island
race have undoubtedly a gift for seizing the imports of
other lands and hall-marking them as their own, and,
in all probability, the Beowulf of the heroic poem was
one who lived and died in the land of Scandinavia.</p>

<p>In Denmark, so goes the story, when the people were
longing for a king, to their shores there drifted, on a day
when the white birds were screaming over the sea-tangle
and wreckage that a stormy sea, now sinking to rest,
was sweeping up on the shore, a little boat in which,
on a sheaf of ripe wheat and surrounded by priceless
weapons and jewels, there lay a most beautiful babe,
who smiled in his sleep. That he was the son of Odin
they had no doubt, and they made him their king, and
served him faithfully and loyally for the rest of his life.</p>

<p>A worthy and a noble king was King Scyld Scefing,
a ruler on land and on the sea, of which even as
an infant he had had no fear. But when many years
had come and gone, and when Scyld Scefing felt that
death drew near, he called his nobles to him and told
them in what manner he fain would pass. So they did
as he said, and in a ship they built a funeral pyre, and
round it placed much gold and jewels, and on it laid a
sheaf of wheat. Then with very great pain and labour,
for he was old and Death&rsquo;s hand lay heavy upon him,
the king climbed into the ship and stretched out his
limbs on the pyre, and said farewell to all his faithful
people. And the ship drifted out with the tide, and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg&nbsp;246]</a></span>
hearts of the watchers were heavy as they saw the sails
of the vessel that bore him vanish into the grey, and knew
that their king had gone back to the place from whence
he came, and that they should look on his face no more.</p>

<p>Behind him Scyld left descendants, and one after
the other reigned over Denmark. It was in the reign
of his great-grandson, Hrothgar, that there took place
those things that are told in the story of Beowulf.</p>

<p>A mighty king and warrior was Hrothgar, and far
across the northern seas his fame spread wide, so that
all the warriors of the land that he ruled were proud
to serve under him in peace, and in war to die for him.
During his long life he and his men never went forth in
their black-prowed ships without returning with the
joyous shouts of the victor, with for cargo the rich spoil
they had won from their enemies. As he grew old,
Hrothgar determined to raise for himself a mighty
monument to the magnificence of his reign, and so there
was builded for him a vast hall with majestic towers
and lofty pinnacles&mdash;the finest banqueting-hall that his
skilled artificers could dream of. And when at length
the hall was completed, Hrothgar gave a feast to all his
thanes, and for days and for nights on end the great
rafters of Heorot&mdash;as his palace was named&mdash;echoed
the shouts and laughter of the mighty warriors, and the
music of the minstrels and the songs that they sang.
A proud man was Hrothgar on the night that the banquet
was ended amidst the acclamations of his people,
and a proud and happy man he lay down to rest, while
his bodyguard of mighty warriors stretched themselves
on the rush-strewn floor of the great room where they
had feasted, and deeply slumbered there.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg&nbsp;247]</a></span>
Now, in the dark fens of that land there dwelt a monster&mdash;fierce,
noisome, and cruel, a thing that loved evil
and hated all that was joyous and good. To its ears
came the ring of the laughter and the shouts of King
Hrothgar&rsquo;s revellers, and the sweet song of the gleemen
and the melody of harps filled it with fierce hatred.
From its wallow in the marshes, where the pestilent grey
fog hung round its dwelling, the monster, known to all
men as the Grendel, came forth, to kill and to devour.
Through the dark night, across the lonely moorland,
it made its way, and the birds of the moor flew screaming
in terror before it, and the wild creatures of the
desolate country over which it padded clapped down
in their coverts and trembled as it passed. It came
at length to the great hall where</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;A fair troop of warrior thanes guarding it found he;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heedlessly sleeping, they recked not of sorrow.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Never a thought did they give to the Grendel,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;A haunter of marshes, a holder of moors,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Or where, covered up in its mist, the hill stream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Downward flows.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Soundly slept Hrothgar, nor opened eye until, in
the bright light of the morning, he was roused by terrified
servants, forgetful of his august royalty, impelled by
terror, crying aloud their terrible tale. They had
come, they said, to lay on the floor of the banqueting-hall,
sweet, fresh rushes from the meadows, and to clear
away all trace of the feasting overnight. But the two-and-thirty
knights who, in full armour, had lain down
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg&nbsp;248]</a></span>
to sleep were all gone, and on the floor was the spoor
of something foul and noisome, and on the walls and on
the trampled rushes were great and terrible smears of
human blood.</p>

<p>They tracked the Grendel back to the marsh from
whence he had come, and shuddered at the sight of
bestial footprints that left blood-stains behind.</p>

<p>Terrible indeed was the grief of Hrothgar, but still
more terrible was his anger. He offered a royal reward to
any man who would slay the Grendel, and full gladly ten
of his warriors pledged themselves to sleep that night in
the great hall and to slay the Grendel ere morning came.</p>

<p>But dawn showed once more a piteous sight. Again
there were only trampled and blood-stained rushes,
with the loathsome smell of unclean flesh. Again the
foul tracks of the monster were found where it had
padded softly back to its noisome fens.</p>

<p>There were many brave men in the kingdom of
Hrothgar the Dane, and yet again did they strive to
maintain the dignity of the great hall, Heorot, and to
uphold the honour of their king. But through twelve
dismal years the Grendel took its toll of the bravest in
the realm, and to sleep in the place that Hrothgar had
built as monument to his magnificent supremacy, ever
meant, for the sleeper, shameful death. Well content
was the Grendel, that grew fat and lusty amongst the
grey mists of the black marshes, unknowing that in the
land of the Goths there was growing to manhood one
whose feet already should be echoing along that path
from which Death was to come.</p>

<p>In the realm of the Goths, Hygelac was king, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg&nbsp;249]</a></span>
no greater hero lived in his kingdom than Beowulf,
his own sister&rsquo;s son. From the age of seven Beowulf
was brought up at the court of his uncle.</p>

<p>A great, fair, blue-eyed lad was Beowulf, lazy, and
very slow to wrath. When he had at last become
a yellow-haired giant, of wondrous good-temper, and
leisurely in movement, the other young warriors of
Gothland had mocked at him as at one who was only
a very huge, very amiable child. But, like others of
the same descent, Beowulf&rsquo;s anger, if slow to kindle,
was a terrible fire once it began to flame. A few
of those flares-up had shown the folk of his uncle&rsquo;s
kingdom that no mean nor evil deed might lightly be
done, nor evil word spoken in the presence of Beowulf.
In battle against the Swedes, no sword had hewn down
more men than the sword of Beowulf. And when the
champion swimmer of the land of the Goths challenged
the young giant Beowulf to swim a match with
him, for five whole days they swam together. A tempest
driving down from the twilight land of the ice and
snow parted them then, and he who had been champion
was driven ashore and thankfully struggled on
to the beach of his own dear country once again. But
the foaming seas cast Beowulf on some jagged cliffs,
and would fain have battered his body into broken
fragments against them, and as he fought and struggled
to resist their raging cruelty, mermaids and nixies and
many monsters of the deep joined forces with the waves
and strove to wrest his life from him. And while with
one hand he held on to a sharp rock, with the other he
dealt with his sword stark blows on those children of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg&nbsp;250]</a></span>
the deep who would fain have devoured him. Their
bodies, deep-gashed and dead, floated down to the
coast of Gothland, and the king and all those who
looked for the corpse of Beowulf saw them, amazed.
Then at length came Beowulf himself, and with great
gladness was he welcomed, and the king, his uncle, gave
him his treasured sword, N&auml;geling, in token of his valour.</p>

<p>In the court of Hrothgar, the number of brave warriors
ever grew smaller. One man only had witnessed
the terrible slaughter of one of those black nights and
yet had kept his life. He was a bard&mdash;a scald&mdash;and from
the land where he had seen such grim horror, he fled to
the land of the Goths, and there, in the court of the king,
he sang the gloomy tale of the never-ending slaughter
of noble warriors by the foul Grendel of the fens and
moors.</p>

<p>Beowulf listened, enthralled, to his song. But those
who knew him saw his eyes gleam as the good steel
blade of a sword gleams when it is drawn for battle,
and when he asked his uncle to allow him to go to the
land of the Danes and slay this filthy thing, his uncle
smiled, with no surprise, and was very well content.</p>

<p>So it came to pass that Beowulf, in his black-prowed
ship, with fourteen trusty followers, set sail from Gothland
for the kingdom of Hrothgar.</p>

<p>The warden of the Danish coast was riding his
rounds one morning when he beheld from the white cliffs
a strange war-vessel making for the shore. Skilfully
the men on board her ran her through the surf, and
beached her in a little creek between the cliffs, and
made her fast to a rock by stout cables. Only for a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg&nbsp;251]</a></span>
little time the valiant warden watched them from afar,
and then, one man against fifteen, he rode quickly down
and challenged the warriors.</p>

<div class="poem">

<span class="i0">None have here landed yet<span class="s1">&nbsp;</span>more frankly coming<br /></span>

</div>
</div>

<p>Then Beowulf, with fearless eyes, gazed in the face
of the warden and told him simply and unboastfully
who he was, from whence he came, and what was his
errand. He had come as the nation&rsquo;s deliverer, to slay
the thing that</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Cometh in dark of night,<span class="s1">&nbsp;</span>sateth his secret hate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Worketh through fearsome awe,<span class="s1">&nbsp;</span>slaughter and shame.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>With joy the warden heard his noble words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My men shall beach your ship,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and
make her fast with a barrier of oars against the greedy
tide. Come with me to the king.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a gallant band that strode into Heorot, where
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg&nbsp;252]</a></span>
sat the old king, gloom overshadowing his soul. And
fit leader for a band of heroes was Beowulf, a giant figure
in ring-mail, spear and shield gleaming in his hand,
and by his side the mighty sword, N&auml;geling. To Hrothgar,
as to the warden, Beowulf told the reason of his
coming, and hope began again to live in the heart of the
king.</p>

<p>That night the warriors from the land of the Goths
were feasted in the great banqueting-hall where, for
twelve unhappy years, voices had never rung out so
bravely and so merrily. The queen herself poured out
the mead with which the king and the men from Gothland
pledged each other, and with her own hand she
passed the goblet to each one. When, last of it all,
it came to the guest of honour, Beowulf took the cup of
mead from the fair queen and solemnly pledged himself
to save the land from the evil thing that devoured
it like a pestilence, or to die in his endeavour.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Needs must I now perform knightly deeds in this hall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or here must meet my doom in darksome night.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>When darkness fell the feast came to an end, and all
left the hall save Beowulf and his fourteen followers.
In their armour, with swords girt on their sides, the
fourteen heroes lay down to rest, but Beowulf laid aside
all his arms and gave his sword to a thane to bear away.
For, said he,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;I have heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That that foul miscreant&rsquo;s dark and stubborn flesh<br /></span>

</div>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg&nbsp;253]</a></span>
From his fastnesses in the fens, the Grendel had
heard the shouts of revelry, and as the Goths closed their
eyes to sleep, knowing they might open them again only
to grapple with hideous death, yet unafraid because of
their sure belief that &ldquo;What is to be goes ever as it
must,&rdquo; the monster roused himself. Through the dank,
chill, clinging mists he came, and his breath made the
poisonous miasma of the marshes more deadly as he
padded over the shivering reeds and trembling rushes,
across the bleak moorland and the high cliffs where
the fresh tang of the grey sea was defiled by the hideous
stench of a foul beast of prey. There was fresh food for
him to-night, he knew, some blood more potent than
any that for twelve years had come his bestial way.
And he hastened on with greedy eagerness, nightmare
incarnate. He found the great door of the banqueting-hall
bolted and barred, but one angry wrench set at
naught the little precautionary measures of mere men.</p>

<p>The dawn was breaking dim and grey and very chill
when Beowulf heard the stealthy tread without, and the
quick-following crash of the bolts and bars that gave
so readily. He made no movement, but only waited.
In an instant the dawn was blotted out by a vast black
shadow, and swifter than any great bear could strike,
a scaly hand had struck one of the friends of Beowulf.
In an instant the man was torn from limb to limb, and
in a wild disgust and hatred Beowulf heard the lapping
of blood, the scrunching of bones and chewing of warm
flesh as the monster ravenously devoured him. Again
the loathsome hand was stretched out to seize and to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg&nbsp;254]</a></span>
devour. But in the darkness two hands, like hands
of iron, gripped the outstretched arm, and the Grendel
knew that he had met his match at last. The warriors
of Beowulf awoke to find a struggle going on such as
their eyes never before beheld, for it was a fight to the
death between man and monster. Vainly they tried
to aid their leader, but their weapons only glanced harmlessly
off the Grendel&rsquo;s scaly hide. Up and down the
hall the combatants wrestled, until the walls shook and
the great building itself rocked to its foundations.
Ever and again it seemed as though no human power
could prevail against teeth and claws and demonic fury,
and as tables and benches crashed to the ground and
broke under the tramping feet of the Grendel, it appeared
an impossible thing that Beowulf should overcome.
Yet ever tighter and more tight grew the iron
grip of Beowulf. His fingers seemed turned to iron.
His hatred and loathing made his grasp crash through
scales, into flesh, and crush the marrow out of the bone
it found there. And when at length the Grendel could
no more, and with a terrible cry wrenched himself free,
and fled, wailing, back to the fenland, still in his grasp
Beowulf held the limb. The Grendel had freed himself by
tearing the whole arm out of its socket, and, for once, the
trail of blood across the moors was that of the monster
and not of its victims.</p>

<p>Great indeed was the rejoicing of Hrothgar and of his
people when, in the morning, instead of crimson-stained
rushes and the track of vermin claws imbrued in human
blood, they found all but one of the men from Gothland
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg&nbsp;255]</a></span>
alive, and looked upon the hideous trophy that told
them that their enemy could only have gone to find
a shameful death in the marshes. They cleansed out
the great hall, hung it with lordly trappings, and made
it once more fit habitation for the lordliest in the land.
That night a feast was held in it, such as had never
before been held all through the magnificent reign of
Hrothgar. The best of the scalds sung songs in honour
of the triumph of Beowulf, and the queen herself pledged
the hero in a cup of mead and gave to him the beautiful
most richly jewelled collar Brisingamen, of exquisite
ancient workmanship, that once was owned by Freya,
queen of the gods, and a great ring of the purest red gold.
To Beowulf, too, the king gave a banner, all broidered
in gold, a sword of the finest, with helmet and
corselet, and eight fleet steeds, and on the back of the
one that he deemed the best Hrothgar had placed
his own saddle, cunningly wrought, and decked with
golden ornaments. To each of the warriors of Beowulf
there were also given rich gifts. And ere the queen, with
her maidens, left the hall that night she said to Beowulf:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Enjoy thy reward, O dear Beowulf, while enjoy it
thou canst. Live noble and blessed! Keep well thy
great fame, and to my dear sons, in time to come, should
ever they be in need, be a kind protector!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With happy hearts in very weary bodies, Beowulf and
his men left the hall when the feast was ended, and they
slept through the night in another lodging as those sleep
who have faced death through a very long night, and to
whom joy has come in the morning.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg&nbsp;256]</a></span>
But the Danish knights, careless in the knowledge
that the Grendel must even now be in his dying agonies,
and that once more Hereot was for them a safe and
noble sleeping-place, lay themselves down to sleep in
the hall, their shields at their heads, and, fastened
high up on the roof above them, the hideous trophy of
Beowulf.</p>

<p>Next morning as the grey dawn broke over the northern
sea, it saw a sight that made it more chill than
death. Across the moorland went a thing&mdash;half wolf,
half woman&mdash;the mother of Grendel. The creature she
had borne had come home to die, and to her belonged
his avenging. Softly she went to Hereot. Softly she
opened the unguarded door. Gladly, in her savage jaws,
she seized Aschere, the thane who was to Hrothgar
most dear, and from the roof she plucked her desired
treasure&mdash;the arm of Grendel, her son. Then she
trotted off to her far-off, filthy den, leaving behind her
the noise of lamentation.</p>

<p>Terrible was the grief of Hrothgar over the death
of Aschere, dearest of friends and sharer of his councils.
And to his lamentations Beowulf listened, sad at heart,
humble, yet with a heart that burned for vengeance.
The hideous creature of the night was the mother of
Grendel, as all knew well. On her Beowulf would be
avenged, for Aschere&rsquo;s sake, for the king&rsquo;s, and for the
sake of his own honour. Then once again did he
pledge himself to do all that man&rsquo;s strength could do
to rid the land of an evil thing. Well did he know how
dangerous was the task before him, and he gave directions
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg&nbsp;257]</a></span>
for the disposal of all that he valued should he
never return from his quest. To the King, who feared
greatly that he was going forth on a forlorn hope, he said:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Grieve not!... Each man must undergo death at the end of life.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let him win, while he may, warlike fame in the world!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That is best after death for the slain warrior.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>His own men, and Hrothgar, and a great company
of Danes went with him when he set out to trace the
blood-stained tracks of the Grendel&rsquo;s mother. Near
the edge of a gloomy mere they found the head of
Aschere. And when they looked at the fiord itself, it
seemed to be blood-stained&mdash;stained with blood that
ever welled upwards, and in which revelled with a
fierce sort of joy&mdash;the rapture of bestial cruelty&mdash;water-monsters
without number.</p>

<p>Beowulf, his face white and grim like that of an
image of Thor cast in silver, watched a little while,
then drew his bow and drove a bolt into the heart
of one of them, and when they had drawn the slain
carcase to shore, the thanes of Hrothgar marvelled at
the horror of it.</p>

<p>Then Beowulf took leave of Hrothgar and told him
that if in two days he did not return, certain it would
be that he would return no more. The hearts of all who
said farewell to him were heavy, but Beowulf laughed,
and bade them be of good cheer. Then into the black
waters he dived, sword in hand, clad in ring-armour,
and the dark pool closed over him as the river of Death
closes over the head of a man when his day is done.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg&nbsp;258]</a></span>
To him it seemed as if the space of a day had passed
ere he reached the bottom, and in his passing he encountered
many dread dangers from tusk and horn of
a myriad evil creatures of the water who sought to
destroy him. Then at length he reached the bottom
of that sinister mere, and there was clasped in the
murderous grip of the Wolf-Woman who strove to crush
his life out against her loathsome breast. Again and
again, when her hideous embrace failed to slay him, she
stabbed him with her knife. Yet ever did he escape.
His good armour resisted the power of her arm, and his
own great muscles thrust her from him. Yet his own
sword failed him when he would have smitten her, and
the hero would have been in evil case had he not spied,
hanging on the wall of that most foul den,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i11">&ldquo;A glorious sword,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An old brand gigantic,<span class="s1">&nbsp;</span>trusty in point and edge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An heirloom of heroes.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Swiftly he seized it, and with it he dealt the Wolf-Woman
a blow that shore her head from her body.
Through the foul blood that flowed from her and that
mingled with the black water of the mere, Beowulf
saw a very terrible horror&mdash;the body of the Grendel,
lying moaning out the last of his life. Again his strong
arm descended, and, his left hand gripping the coiled
locks of the Evil Thing, he sprang upwards through
the water, that lost its blackness and its clouded crimson
as he went ever higher and more high. In his hand
he still bore the sword that had saved him, but the
poisonous blood of the dying monsters had made the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg&nbsp;259]</a></span>
water of such fiery heat that the blade melted as he rose,
and only the hilt, with strange runes engraved upon it,
remained in his hand.</p>

<p>Where he left them, his followers, and the Danes
who went with them, remained, watching, waiting,
ever growing more hopeless as night turned into day,
and day faded into night, and they saw the black waters
of the lonely fen bubbling up, terrible and blood-stained.
But when the waters cleared, hope returned to their
hearts, and when, at length, Beowulf uprose from the
water of the mere and they saw that in his hand he
bore the head of the Grendel, there was no lonely scaur,
nor cliff, nor rock of the land of the Danes that did not
echo the glad cry of &ldquo;<em>Beowulf! Beowulf!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well-nigh overwhelmed by gifts from those whom
he had preserved was the hero, Beowulf. But in modest,
wise words he spoke to the King:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">&ldquo;Well hast thou treated us.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If on this earth I can<span class="s1">&nbsp;</span>do more to win thy love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O prince of warriors,<span class="s1">&nbsp;</span>than I have wrought as yet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here stand I ready now<span class="s1">&nbsp;</span>weapons to wield for thee.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If I shall ever hear<span class="s1">&nbsp;</span>o&rsquo;er the encircling flood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That any neighbouring foes<span class="s1">&nbsp;</span>threaten thy nation&rsquo;s fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As Grendel grim before,<span class="s1">&nbsp;</span>swift will I bring to thee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thousands of noble thanes,<span class="s1">&nbsp;</span>heroes to help thee.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then, in their ship, that the Warden of the Coast once
had challenged, Beowulf and his warriors set sail for their
own dear land.</p>

<p>Gaily the vessel danced over the waves, heavy
though it was with treasure, nobly gained. And when
Beowulf had come in safety to his homeland and had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg&nbsp;260]</a></span>
told his kinsman the tale of the slaying of the Grendel
and of the Wolf-Woman, he gave the finest of his steeds
to the King, and to the Queen the jewelled collar,
Brisingamen, that the Queen of the Goths had bestowed
on him. And the heart of his uncle was glad and proud
indeed, and there was much royal banqueting in the
hero&rsquo;s honour. Of him, too, the scalds made up songs,
and there was no hero in all that northern land whose
fame was as great as was the fame of Beowulf.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Must Be often helps an undoomed man when
he is brave&rdquo; was the precept on which he ruled his life,
and he never failed the King whose chief champion
and warrior he was. When, in an expedition against
the Frieslanders, King Hygelac fell a victim to the
cunning of his foes, the sword of Beowulf fought nobly
for him to the end, and the hero was a grievously
wounded man when he brought back to Gothland the
body of the dead King. The Goths would fain have
made him their King, in Hygelac&rsquo;s stead, but Beowulf
was too loyal a soul to supplant his uncle&rsquo;s own son. On
his shield he laid the infant prince, Hardred, and held
him up for the people to see. And when he had proclaimed
the child King and vowed to serve him faithfully
all the days of his life, there was no man there who
did not loyally echo the promise of their hero, Beowulf.</p>

<p>When Hardred, a grown man, was treacherously slain
by a son of Othere, he who discovered the North Cape,
Beowulf once again was chosen King, and for forty years
he reigned wisely and well. The fame of his arms kept
war away from the land, and his wisdom as a statesman
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg&nbsp;261]</a></span>
brought great prosperity and happiness to his people.
He had never known fear, and so for him there was
nothing to dread when the weakness of age fell upon
him and when he knew that his remaining years could
be but few:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Seeing that Death, a necessary end,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will come when it will come.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a><br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Through all those years of peace, the thing that was
to bring death to him had lurked, unknown, unimagined,
in a cave in the lonely mountains.</p>

<p>Many centuries before the birth of Beowulf, a family
of mighty warriors had won by their swords a priceless
treasure of weapons and of armour, of richly chased
goblets and cups, of magnificent ornaments and precious
jewels, and of gold &ldquo;beyond the dreams of avarice.&rdquo;
In a great cave among the rocks it was hoarded by the
last of their line, and on his death none knew where it
was hidden. Upon it one day there stumbled a fiery
dragon&mdash;a Firedrake&mdash;and for three hundred years the
monster gloated, unchallenged, over the magnificent
possession. But at the end of that time, a bondsman,
who fled before his master&rsquo;s vengeance and sought
sanctuary in the mountains, came on an opening in the
rocks, and, creeping in, found the Firedrake asleep upon
a mass of red gold and of sparkling gems that dazzled
his eyes even in the darkness. For a moment he stood,
trembling, then, sure of his master&rsquo;s forgiveness if he
brought him as gift a golden cup all studded with jewels,
he seized one and fled with it ere the monster could
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg&nbsp;262]</a></span>
awake. With its awakening, terror fell upon the land.
Hither and thither it flew, searching for him who had
robbed it, and as it flew, it sent flames on the earth and
left behind it a black trail of ruin and of death.</p>

<p>When news of its destroyings came to the ears of
the father of his people, Beowulf knew that to him
belonged the task of saving the land for them and for
all those to come after them. But he was an old man,
and strength had gone from him, nor was he able now
to wrestle with the Firedrake as once he had wrestled
with the Grendel and the Wolf-Woman, but had to trust
to his arms. He had an iron shield made to withstand
the Firedrake&rsquo;s flaming breath, and, with a band of
eleven picked followers, and taking the bondsman as
guide, Beowulf went out to fight his last fight. As they
drew near the place, he bade his followers stay where
they were, &ldquo;For I alone,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;will win the gold
and save my people, or Death shall take me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From the entrance to the cave there poured forth
a sickening cloud of steam and smoke, suffocating and
blinding, and so hot that he could not go forward. But
with a loud voice the old warrior shouted an arrogant
challenge of defiance to his enemy, and the Firedrake
rushed forth from its lair, roaring with the roar of an
unquenchable fire whose fury will destroy a city. From
its wings of flame and from its eyes heat poured forth
scorchingly, and its great mouth belched forth devouring
flames as it cast itself on Beowulf.</p>

<span class="caption">A STROKE SHIVERED THE SWORD</span>
</div>

<p>The hero&rsquo;s sword flashed, and smote a stark blow
upon its scaly head. But Beowulf could not deal death
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg&nbsp;263]</a></span>
strokes as once he had done, and only for a moment was
his adversary stunned. In hideous rage the monster
coiled its snaky folds around him, and the heat from his
body made the iron shield redden as though the blacksmith
in his smithy were welding it, and each ring of the
armour that Beowulf wore seared right into his flesh.
His breast swelled with the agony, and his great heart
must have come near bursting for pain and for sorrow.
For he saw that panic had come on his followers and
that they were fleeing, leaving him to his fate. Yet not
all of them were faithless. Wiglaf, young and daring, a
dear kinsman of Beowulf, from whom he had received
many a kindness, calling shame on the dastards who
fled, rushed forward, sword in hand, and with no protection
but that of his shield of linden wood. Like a
leaf scorched in a furnace the shield curled up, but new
strength came to Beowulf with the knowledge that
Wiglaf had not failed him in his need. Together the two
heroes made a gallant stand, although blood flowed in
a swift red stream from a wound that the monster had
made in Beowulf&rsquo;s neck with its venomous fangs, and
ran down his corselet. A stroke which left the Firedrake
unharmed shivered the sword that had seen many fights,
but Wiglaf smote a shrewd blow ere his lord could be
destroyed, and Beowulf swiftly drew his broad knife and,
with an effort so great that all the life that was left in him
seemed to go with it, he shore the Firedrake asunder.</p>

<p>Then Beowulf knew that his end drew very near,
and when he had thanked Wiglaf for his loyal help, he
bade him enter the cave and bring forth the treasure
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg&nbsp;264]</a></span>
that he might please his dying eyes by looking on the
riches that he had won for his people. And Wiglaf
hastened into the cave, for he knew that he raced with
Death, and brought forth armfuls of weapons, of magnificent
ornaments, of goblets and of cups, of bars of
red gold. Handfuls of sparkling jewels, too, he brought,
and each time he came and went, seizing without choosing,
whatever lay nearest, it seemed as though the Firedrake&rsquo;s
hoard were endless. A magical golden standard
and armour and swords that the dwarfs had made
brought a smile of joy into the dying King&rsquo;s eyes. And
when the ten shamed warriors, seeing that the fight
was at an end, came to where their mighty ruler lay,
they found him lying near the vile carcase of the monster
he had slain, and surrounded by a dazzlement of treasure
uncountable. To them, and to Wiglaf, Beowulf spoke
his valediction, urging on them to maintain the honour
of the land of the Goths, and then he said:</p>

Such was the passing of Beowulf, greatest of Northern
heroes, and under a mighty barrow on a cliff very high
above the sea, they buried him, and with him a great
fortune from the treasure he had won. Then with
heavy hearts, &ldquo;round about the mound rode his hearth-sharers,
who sang that he was of kings, of men, the
mildest, kindest, to his people sweetest, and the readiest

<p>The old chroniclers tell us that on that momentous
morning when William the Conqueror led his army to
victory at Hastings, a Norman knight named Taillefer
(and a figure of iron surely was his) spurred his horse
to the front. In face of the enemy who hated all things
that had to do with France, he lifted up his voice
and chanted aloud the exploits of Charlemagne and of
Roland. As he sang, he threw his sword in the air
and always caught it in his right hand as it fell, and,
proudly, the whole army, moving at once, joined with
him in the <i>Chanson de Roland</i>, and shouted, as chorus,
&ldquo;God be our help! God be our help!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Wace</span>, <i>Roman de Rose</i>.</p>

<p>Fifteen thousand of those who sang fell on that
bloody day, and one wonders how many of those who
went down to the Shades owed half their desperate
courage to the remembrance of the magnificent deeds
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg&nbsp;267]</a></span>
of the hero of whom they sang, ere ever sword met
sword, or spear met the sullen impact of the stark frame
of a Briton born, fighting for his own.</p>

<p>The story of Roland, so we are told, is only a splendid
coating of paint put on a very slender bit of drawing.
A contemporary chronicle tells of the battle of Roncesvalles,
and says: &ldquo;In which battle was slain Roland,
prefect of the marches of Brittany.&rdquo; Merely a Breton
squire, we are told to believe&mdash;a very gallant country
gentleman whose name would not have been preserved
in priestly archives had he not won for himself, by his
fine courage, such an unfading laurel crown. But because
we are so sure that &ldquo;it is the memory that the
soldier leaves after him, like the long trail of light that
follows the sunken sun,&rdquo; and because so often oral
tradition is less misleading than the written word, we
gladly and undoubtingly give Roland high place in the
Valhalla of heroes of all races and of every time.</p>

<p>777 or 778 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> is the date fixed for the great fight
at Roncesvalles, where Roland won death and glory.
Charlemagne, King of the Franks, and Head of the Holy
Roman Empire, was returning victoriously from a seven
years&rsquo; campaign against the Saracens in Spain.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;No fortress stands before him unsubdued,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor wall, nor city left to be destroyed,&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>save one&mdash;the city of Saragossa, the stronghold of King
Marsile or Marsiglio. Here amongst the mountains the
King and his people still held to their idols, worshipped
&ldquo;Mahommed, Apollo, and Termagaunt,&rdquo; and looked
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg&nbsp;268]</a></span>
forward with horror to a day when the mighty Charlemagne
might, by the power of the sword, thrust upon
them the worship of the crucified Christ. Ere Charlemagne
had returned to his own land, Marsile held a
council with his peers. To believe that the great conqueror
would rest content with Saragossa still unconquered
was too much to hope for. Surely he would
return to force his religion upon them. What, then,
was it best to do? A very wily emir was Blancandrin,
brave in war, and wise in counsel, and on his advice
Marsile sent ambassadors to Charlemagne to ask of him
upon what conditions he would be allowed to retain
his kingdom in peace and to continue to worship the
gods of his fathers. Mounted on white mules, with
silver saddles, and with reins of gold, and bearing olive
branches in their hands, Blancandrin and the ten messengers
sent by Marsile arrived at Cordova, where
Charlemagne rested with his army. Fifteen thousand
tried veterans were with him there, and his &ldquo;Douzeperes&rdquo;&mdash;his
Twelve Peers&mdash;who were to him what the
Knights of the Round Table were to King Arthur of
Britain. He held his court in an orchard, and under
a great pine tree from which the wild honeysuckle
hung like a fragrant canopy, the mighty king and
emperor sat on a throne of gold.</p>

<p>The messengers of Marsile saw a man of much more
than ordinary stature and with the commanding presence
of one who might indeed conquer kingdoms, but his
sword was laid aside and he watched contentedly the
contests between the older of his knights who played
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg&nbsp;269]</a></span>
chess under the shade of the fruit trees, and the fencing
bouts of the younger warriors. Very dear to him were
all his Douzeperes, yet dearest of all was his own nephew,
Roland. In him he saw his own youth again, his own
imperiousness, his reckless gallantry, his utter fearlessness&mdash;all
those qualities which endeared him to the
hearts of other men. Roland was his sister&rsquo;s son, and it
was an evil day for the fair Bertha when she told her
brother that, in spite of his anger and scorn, she had
disobeyed his commands and had wed the man she
loved, Milon, a poor young knight.</p>

<p>No longer would Charlemagne recognise her as
sister, and in obscurity and poverty Roland was born.
He was still a very tiny lad when his father, in attempting
to ford a flooded river, was swept down-stream and
drowned, and Bertha had no one left to fend for her
and for her child. Soon they had no food left, and the
little Roland watched with amazed eyes his famished
mother growing so weak that she could not rise from the
bed where she lay, nor answer him when he pulled her
by the hand and tried to make her come with him to
seek his father and to find something to eat. And
when he saw that it was hopeless, the child knew that
he must take his father&rsquo;s place and get food for the
mother who lay so pale, and so very still. Into a great
hall where Charlemagne and his lords were banqueting
Roland strayed. Here was food in plenty! Savoury
smelling, delicious to his little empty stomach were the
daintily cooked meats which the Emperor and his
court ate from off their silver platters. Only one
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg&nbsp;270]</a></span>
plateful of food such as this must, of a surety, make his
dear mother strong and well once more. Not for a
moment did Roland hesitate. Even as a tiny sparrow
darts into a lion&rsquo;s cage and picks up a scrap almost out
of the monarch&rsquo;s hungry jaws, so acted Roland. A
plateful of food stood beside the King. At this Roland
sprang, seized it with both hands, and joyfully ran off
with his prey. When the serving men would have
caught him, Charlemagne, laughing, bade them desist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A hungry one this,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and very bold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the meal went on, and when Roland had fed his
mother with some pieces of the rich food and had seen
her gradually revive, yet another thought came to his
baby mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My father gave her wine,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;They
were drinking wine in that great hall. It will make her
white cheeks red again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus he ran back, as fast as his legs could carry
him, and Charlemagne smiled yet more when he saw
the beautiful child, who knew no fear, return to the
place where he had thieved. Right up to the King&rsquo;s
chair he came, solemnly measured with his eye the cups
of wine that the great company quaffed, saw that the
cup of Charlemagne was the most beautiful and the
fullest of the purple-red wine, stretched out a daring
little hand, grasped the cup, and prepared to go off
again, like a marauding bright-eyed bird. Then the
King seized in his own hand the hand that held
the cup.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! no! bold thief,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I cannot have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg&nbsp;271]</a></span>
my golden cup stolen from me, be it done by ever
so sturdy a robber. Tell me, who sent thee out to
steal?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Roland, an erect, gallant, little figure, his hand
still in the iron grip of the King, fearlessly and proudly
gazed back into the eyes of Charlemagne.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one sent me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My mother lay very
cold and still and would not speak, and she had said
my father would come back no more, so there was none
but me to seek her food. Give me the wine, I say! for
she is so cold and so very, very white&rdquo;&mdash;and the child
struggled to free his hand that still held the cup.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who art thou, then?&rdquo; asked Charlemagne.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My name is Roland&mdash;let me go, I pray thee,&rdquo; and
again he tried to drag himself free. And Charlemagne
mockingly said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Roland, I fear thy father and mother have taught
thee to be a clever thief.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then anger blazed in Roland&rsquo;s eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My mother is a lady of high degree!&rdquo; he cried,
&ldquo;and I am her page, her cupbearer, her knight!
I do not speak false words!&rdquo;&mdash;and he would have
struck the King for very rage.</p>

<p>Then Charlemagne turned to his lords and asked&mdash;&ldquo;Who
is this child?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And one made answer: &ldquo;He is the son of thy
sister Bertha, and of Milon the knight, who was drowned
these three weeks agone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the heart of Charlemagne grew heavy with
remorse when he found that his sister had so nearly died
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg&nbsp;272]</a></span>
of want, and from that day she never knew aught but
kindness and tenderness from him, while Roland was
dear to him as his own child.</p>

<p>He was a Douzepere now, and when the envoys from
Saragossa had delivered their message to Charlemagne,
he was one of those who helped to do them honour at
a great feast that was held for them in a pavilion raised
in the orchard.</p>

<p>Early in the morning Charlemagne heard mass, and
then, on his golden throne under the great pine, he sat
and took counsel with his Douzeperes. Not one of them
trusted Marsile, but Ganelon, who had married the
widowed Bertha and who had a jealous hatred for his
step-son&mdash;so beloved by his mother, so loved and
honoured by the King&mdash;was ever ready to oppose the
counsel of Roland. Thus did he persuade Charlemagne
to send a messenger to Marsile, commanding him to
deliver up the keys of Saragossa, in all haste to become
a Christian, and in person to come and, with all humility,
pay homage as vassal to Charlemagne.</p>

<p>Then arose the question as to which of the peers
should bear the arrogant message. Roland, ever greedy
for the post of danger, impetuously asked that he might
be chosen. But Charlemagne would have neither him
nor his dear friend and fellow-knight, Oliver&mdash;he who
was the Jonathan of Roland&rsquo;s David&mdash;nor would he
have Naismes de Bavi&egrave;re, nor Turpin, &ldquo;the chivalrous
and undaunted Bishop of Rheims.&rdquo; He could not
afford to risk their lives, and Marsile was known to be
treacherous. Then he said to his peers:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg&nbsp;273]</a></span>
&ldquo;Choose ye for me whom I shall send. Let it be
one who is wise; brave, yet not over-rash, and who will
defend mine honour valiantly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Roland, who never knew an ungenerous thought,
quickly said: &ldquo;Then, indeed, it must be Ganelon who
goes, for if he goes, or if he stays, you have none better
than he.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And all the other peers applauded the choice, and
Charlemagne said to Ganelon:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come hither, Ganelon, and receive my staff and
glove, which the voice of all the Franks have given to
thee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the honour which all the others coveted was
not held to be an honour by Ganelon. In furious rage
he turned upon Roland:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You and your friends have sent me to my death!&rdquo;
he cried. &ldquo;But if by a miracle I should return, look
you to yourself, Roland, for assuredly I shall be revenged!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Roland grew red, then very white, and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had taken thee for another man, Ganelon. Gladly
will I take thy place. Wilt give me the honour to bear
thy staff and glove to Saragossa, sire?&rdquo; And eagerly
he looked Charlemagne in the face&mdash;eager as, when a
child, he had craved the cup of wine for his mother&rsquo;s
sake.</p>

<p>But Charlemagne, with darkened brow, shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ganelon must go,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for so have I commanded.
Go! for the honour of Jesus Christ, and for
your Emperor.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg&nbsp;274]</a></span>
Thus, sullenly and unwillingly, and with burning
hatred against Roland in his heart, Ganelon accompanied
the Saracens back to Saragossa. A hate so bitter was
not easy to hide, and as he rode beside him the wily
Blancandrin was not long in laying a probing finger on
this festering sore. Soon he saw that Ganelon would
pay even the price of his honour to revenge himself
upon Roland and on the other Douzeperes whose lives
were more precious than his in the eyes of Charlemagne.
Yet, when Saragossa was reached, like a brave man and
a true did Ganelon deliver the insulting message that his
own brain had conceived and that the Emperor, with
magnificent arrogance, had bidden him deliver. And
this he did, although he knew his life hung but by a thread
while Marsile and the Saracen lords listened to his words.
But Marsile kept his anger under, thinking with comfort
of what Blancandrin had told him of his discovery by
the way. And very soon he had shown Ganelon how he
might be avenged on Roland and on the friends of Roland,
and in a manner which his treachery need never be
known, and very rich were the bribes that he offered
to the faithless knight.</p>

<p>Thus it came about that Ganelon sold his honour,
and bargained with the Saracens to betray Roland and
his companions into their hands in their passage of
the narrow defiles of Roncesvalles. For more than fifty
pieces of silver Marsile purchased the soul of Ganelon,
and when this Judas of the Douzeperes returned in
safety to Cordova, bringing with him princely gifts for
Charlemagne, the keys of Saragossa, and the promise
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg&nbsp;275]</a></span>
that in sixteen days Marsile would repair to France
to do homage and to embrace the Christian faith, the
Emperor was happy indeed. All had fallen out as he
desired. Ganelon, who had gone forth in wrath, had
returned calm and gallant, and had carried himself
throughout his difficult embassy as a wise statesman and
a brave and loyal soldier.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thou hast done well, Ganelon,&rdquo; said the king.
&ldquo;I give thanks to my God and to thee. Thou shalt be
well rewarded.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The order then was speedily given for a return to
France, and for ten miles the great army marched
before they halted and encamped for the night. But
when Charlemagne slept, instead of dreams of peace he
had two dreams which disturbed him greatly. In the
first, Ganelon roughly seized the imperial spear of tough
ash-wood and it broke into splinters in his hand. In
the next, Charlemagne saw himself attacked by a leopard
and a bear, which tore off his right arm, and as a greyhound
darted to his aid he awoke, and rose from his couch
heavy at heart because of those dreams of evil omen.</p>

<p>In the morning he held a council and reminded his
knights of the dangers of the lonely pass of Roncesvalles.
It was a small oval plain, shut in all round,
save on the south where the river found its outlet, by
precipitous mountain ridges densely covered with beech
woods. Mountains ran sheer up to the sky above it,
precipices rushed sheer down below, and the path that
crossed the crest of the Pyrenees and led to it was so
narrow that it must be traversed in single file. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg&nbsp;276]</a></span>
dangers for the rearguard naturally seemed to Charlemagne
to be the greatest, and to his Douzeperes he
turned, as before, for counsel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who, then, shall command the rearguard?&rdquo; he asked.
And quickly Ganelon answered, &ldquo;Who but Roland?
Ever would he seek the post where danger lies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Charlemagne, feeling he owed much to Ganelon,
gave way to his counsel, though with heavy forebodings
in his heart. Then all the other Douzeperes, save
Ganelon, said that for love of Roland they would go
with him and see him safely through the dangers of the
way. Loudly they vaunted his bravery:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;<i>For dred of dethe, he hid neuer his hed.</i>&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Leaving them behind with twenty thousand men, and
with Ganelon commanding the vanguard, Charlemagne
started.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Christ keep you!&rdquo; he said on parting with Roland&mdash;&ldquo;<em>I
betak you to Crist.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Roland, clad in his shining armour, his lordly
helmet on his head, his sword Durendala by his side,
his horn Olifant slung round him, and his flower-painted
shield on his arm, mounted his good steed
Veillantif, and, holding his bright lance with its white
pennon and golden fringe in his hand, led the way for
his fellow-knights and for the other Franks who so
dearly loved him.</p>

<p>Not far from the pass of Roncesvalles he saw, gleaming
against the dark side of the purple mountain, the
spears of the Saracens. Ten thousand men, under Sir
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg&nbsp;277]</a></span>
Gautier, were sent by Roland to reconnoitre, but from
every side the heathen pressed upon them, and every
one of the ten thousand were slain&mdash;hurled into the valley
far down below. Gautier alone, sorely wounded, returned
to Roland, to tell him, ere his life ebbed away,
of the betrayal by Ganelon, and to warn him of the
ambush. Yet even then they were at Roncesvalles,
and the warning came too late. Afar off, amongst the
beech trees, and coming down amongst the lonely passes
of the mountains, the Franks could see the gleam of
silver armour, and Oliver, well knowing that not even
the most dauntless valour could withstand such a host
as the one that came against them, besought Roland
to blow a blast on his magic horn that Charlemagne might
hear and return to aid him. And all the other Douzeperes
begged of him that thus he would call for help.
But Roland would not listen to them.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;I will fight with them that us hathe sought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And or I se my brest blod throughe my harnes ryn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blow never horn for no help then.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Through the night they knew their enemies were
coming ever nearer, hemming them in, but there were
no night alarms, and day broke fair and still. There
was no wind, there was dew on the grass; &ldquo;dew dymmd
the floures,&rdquo; and amongst the trees the birds sang merrily.
At daybreak the good Bishop Turpin celebrated Mass
and blessed them, and even as his voice ceased they beheld
the Saracen host close upon them. Then Roland
spoke brave words of cheer to his army and commended
their souls and his own to Christ, &ldquo;who suffrid for us
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg&nbsp;278]</a></span>
paynes sore,&rdquo; and for whose sake they had to fight the
enemies of the Cross. Behind every tree and rock
a Saracen seemed to be hidden, and in a moment the
whole pass was alive with men in mortal strife.</p>

<p>Surely never in any fight were greater prodigies of
valour performed than those of Roland and his comrades.
Twelve Saracen kings fell before their mighty swords,
and many a Saracen warrior was hurled down the cliffs
to pay for the lives of the men of France whom they
had trapped to their death. Never before, in one day,
did one man slay so many as did Roland and Oliver his
friend&mdash;&ldquo;A Roland for an Oliver&rdquo; was no good exchange,
and yet a very fair one, as the heathen quickly learned.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Red was Roland, red with bloodshed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Red his corselet, red his shoulders,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Red his arm, and red his charger.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the thickest of the fight he and Oliver came together,
and Roland saw that his friend was using for weapon
and dealing death-blows with the truncheon of a spear.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Friend, what hast thou there?&rsquo; cried Roland.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&lsquo;In this game &rsquo;tis not a distaff,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But a blade of steel thou needest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where is now Hauteclaire, thy good sword,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Golden-hilted, crystal-pommelled?&rsquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Here,&rsquo; said Oliver; &lsquo;so fight I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I have not time to draw it.&rsquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Friend,&rsquo; quoth Roland, &lsquo;more I love thee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ever henceforth than a brother.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>When the sun set on that welter of blood, not a single
Saracen was left, and those of the Frankish rearguard
who still lived were very weary men.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg&nbsp;279]</a></span>
Then Roland called on his men to give thanks to
God, and Bishop Turpin, whose stout arm had fought
well on that bloody day, offered up thanks for the
army, though in sorry plight were they, almost none
unwounded, their swords and lances broken, and their
hauberks rent and blood-stained. Gladly they laid
themselves down to rest beside the comrades whose
eyes never more would open on the fair land of France,
but even as Roland was about to take his rest he saw
descending upon him and his little band a host of
Saracens, led by Marsile himself.</p>

<p>A hundred thousand men, untired, and fiercely thirsting
for revenge, came against the handful of wearied,
wounded heroes. Yet with unwavering courage the
Franks responded to their leaders&rsquo; call.</p>

<p>The war-cry of the soldiers of France&mdash;&ldquo;Montjoie!
Montjoie!&rdquo;&mdash;rang clear above the fierce sound of the
trumpets of the Saracen army.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Soldiers of the Lord,&rsquo; cried Turpin,<br /></span>

</div>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg&nbsp;280]</a></span>
Marsile fell, the first victim to a blow from the sword
of Roland, and even more fiercely than the one that had
preceded it, waged this terrible fight.</p>

<p>And now it seemed as though the Powers of Good and
of Evil also took part in the fray, for a storm swept down
from the mountains, thick darkness fell, and the rumble
of thunder and the rush of heavy rain dulled the shouts
of those who fought and the clash and clang of their
weapons. When a blood-red cloud came up, its lurid
light showed the trampled ground strewn with dead and
dying. At that piteous sight Roland proposed to send
a messenger to Charlemagne to ask him for aid, but it
was then too late.</p>

<p>When only sixty Franks remained, the pride of Roland
gave way to pity for the men whom he had led to death,
and he took the magic horn Olifant in his hand, that he
might blow on it a blast that would bring Charlemagne,
his mighty army behind him, to wipe out the Saracen
host that had done him such evil. But Oliver bitterly
protested. Earlier in the day, when he had willed it,
Roland had refused to call for help. Now the day was
done. The twilight of death&mdash;Death the inevitable&mdash;was
closing in upon them. Why, then, call now for Charlemagne,
when nor he nor any other could help them?
But Turpin with all his force backed the wish of Roland.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The blast of thy horn cannot bring back the dead
to life,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Yet if our Emperor return he can
save our corpses and weep over them and bear them
reverently to la belle France. And there shall they lie
in sanctuary, and not in a Paynim land where the wild
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg&nbsp;281]</a></span>
beasts devour them and croaking wretches with foul
beaks tear our flesh and leave our bones dishonoured.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is well said,&rdquo; quoth Roland and Oliver.</p>

<p>Then did Roland blow three mighty blasts upon his
horn, and so great was the third that a blood-vessel
burst, and the red drops trickled from his mouth.</p>

<p>For days on end Charlemagne had been alarmed at
the delay of his rearguard, but ever the false Ganelon
had reassured him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why shouldst thou fear, sire?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Roland
has surely gone after some wild boar or deer, so fond is
he of the chase.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But when Roland blew the blast that broke his
mighty heart, Charlemagne heard it clearly, and no
longer had any doubt of the meaning of its call. He
knew that his dreams had come true, and at once he
set his face towards the dire pass of Roncesvalles that
he might, even at the eleventh hour, save Roland and
his men.</p>

<p>Long ere Charlemagne could reach the children
of his soul who stood in such dire need, the uncle of
Marsile had reached the place of battle with a force of
fifty thousand men. Pierced from behind by a cowardly
lance, Oliver was sobbing out his life&rsquo;s blood. Yet ever
he cried, &ldquo;Montjoie! Montjoie!&rdquo; and each time his
voice formed the words, a thrust from his sword, or from
the lances of his men, drove a soul down to Hades.
And when he was breathing his last, and lay on the
earth, humbly confessing his sins and begging God to
grant him rest in Paradise, he asked God&rsquo;s blessing upon
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg&nbsp;282]</a></span>
Charlemagne, his lord the king, and upon his fair land
of France, and, above all other men, to keep free from
scathe his heart&rsquo;s true brother and comrade, Roland,
the gallant knight. Then did he gently sigh his last
little measure of life away, and as Roland bent over
him he felt that half of the glamour of living was gone.
Yet still so dearly did he love Aude the Fair, the sister
of Oliver, who was to be his bride, that his muscles
grew taut as he gripped his sword, and his courage was
the dauntless courage of a furious wave that faces all
the cliffs of a rocky coast in a winter storm, when again,
he faced the Saracen host.</p>

<p>Of all the Douzeperes, only Gautier and Turpin and
Roland now remained, and with them a poor little
handful of maimed men-at-arms. Soon a Saracen arrow
drove through the heart of Gautier, and Turpin, wounded
by four lances, stood alone by Roland&rsquo;s side. But for
each lance thrust he slew a hundred men, and when at
length he fell, Roland, himself sorely wounded, seized
once more his horn and blew upon it a piercing blast:</p>

<span class="caption">ROLAND SEIZED ONCE MORE HIS HORN</span>
</div>

<p>That blast pierced right into the heart of Charlemagne,
and straightway he turned his army towards the pass of
Roncesvalles that he might succour Roland, whom he so
greatly loved. Yet then it was too late. Turpin was
nearly dead. Roland knew himself to be dying.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg&nbsp;283]</a></span>
Veillantif, Roland&rsquo;s faithful warhorse, was enduring agonies
from wounds of the Paynim arrows, and him Roland slew
with a shrewd blow from his well-tried sword. From
far, far away the hero could hear the blare of the trumpets
of the Frankish army, and, at the sound, what was left
of the Saracen host fled in terror. He made his way,
blindly, painfully, to where Turpin lay, and with fumbling
fingers took off his hauberk and unlaced his golden
helmet. With what poor skill was left to him, he strove
to bind up his terrible wounds with strips of his own
tunic, and he dragged him, as gently as he could, to a
spot under the beech trees where the fresh moss still
was green.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Ah, gentle lord,&rsquo; said Roland, &lsquo;give me leave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To carry here our comrades who are dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom we so dearly loved; they must not lie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unblest; but I will bring their corpses here<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thou shalt bless them, and me, ere thou die.&rsquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Go,&rsquo; said the dying priest, &lsquo;but soon return.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thank God! the victory is yours and mine!&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>With exquisite pain Roland carried the bodies
of Oliver and of the rest of the Douzeperes from
the places where they had died to where Turpin, their
dear bishop, lay a-dying. Each step that he took cost
him a pang of agony; each step took from him a
toll of blood. Yet faithfully he performed his task,
until they all lay around Turpin, who gladly blessed
them and absolved them all. And then the agony of
soul and of heart and body that Roland had endured
grew overmuch for him to bear, and he gave a great cry,
like the last sigh of a mighty tree that the woodcutters
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg&nbsp;284]</a></span>
fell, and dropped down, stiff and chill, in a deathly swoon.
Then the dying bishop dragged himself towards him
and lifted the horn Olifant, and with it in his hand he
struggled, inch by inch, with very great pain and labour,
to a little stream that trickled down the dark ravine,
that he might fetch some water to revive the hero
that he and all men loved. But ere he could reach the
stream, the mists of death had veiled his eyes. He
joined his hands in prayer, though each movement
meant a pang, and gave his soul to Christ, his Saviour
and his Captain. And so passed away the soul of a
mighty warrior and a stainless priest.</p>

<p>Thus was Roland alone amongst the dead when consciousness
came back to him. With feeble hands he unlaced
his helmet and tended to himself as best he might.
And, as Turpin had done, so also did he painfully crawl
towards the stream. There he found Turpin, the horn
Olifant by his side, and knew that it was in trying
to fetch him water that the brave bishop had died,
and for tenderness and pity the hero wept.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Alas! brave priest, fair lord of noble birth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy soul I give to the great King of Heaven!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And Paradise receive thee in its bowers!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then did Roland know that for him, also, there
&ldquo;was no other way but death.&rdquo; With dragging steps
he toiled uphill a little way, his good sword Durendala in
one hand, and in the other his horn Olifant. Under a little
clump of pines were some rough steps hewn in a boulder of
marble leading yet higher up the hill, and these Roland
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg&nbsp;285]</a></span>
would have climbed, but his throbbing heart could no
more, and again he fell swooning on the ground. A Saracen
who, out of fear, had feigned death, saw him lying there
and crawled out of the covert where he lay concealed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is Roland, the nephew of the Emperor!&rdquo; he joyously
thought, and in triumph he said to himself, &ldquo;I shall
bear his sword back with me!&rdquo; But as his Pagan hand
touched the hilt of the sword and would have torn it from
Roland&rsquo;s dying grasp, the hero was aroused from his swoon.
One great stroke cleft the Saracen&rsquo;s skull and laid him dead
at Roland&rsquo;s feet. Then to Durendala Roland spoke:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;I surely die; but, ere I end,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let me be sure that thou art ended too my friend!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For should a heathen grasp thee when I am clay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My ghost would grieve full sore until the judgment day!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>More ghost than man he looked as with a mighty
effort of will and of body he struggled to his feet and
smote with his blade the marble boulder. Before the
stroke the marble split asunder as though the pick-axe
of a miner had cloven it. On a rock of sardonyx he
strove to break it then, but Durendala remained unharmed.
A third time he strove, and struck a rock of
blue marble with such force that the sparks rushed
out as from a blacksmith&rsquo;s anvil. Then he knew that
it was in vain, for Durendala would not be shattered.
And so he raised Olifant to his lips and blew a dying
blast that echoed down the cliffs and up to the mountain
tops and rang through the trees of the forest. And still,
to this day, do they say, when the spirit of the warrior
rides by night down the heights and through the dark
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg&nbsp;286]</a></span>
pass of Roncesvalles, even such a blast may be heard,
waking all the echoes and sounding through the lonely
hollows of the hills.</p>

<p>Then he made confession, and with a prayer for pardon
of his sins and for mercy from the God whose faithful
servant and soldier he had been unto his life&rsquo;s end, the
soul of Roland passed away.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">&ldquo;... With hands devoutly joined<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The soul of Count Rolland to Paradise.<br /></span>
<span class="i13">Aoi.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Charlemagne and his army found him lying thus, and
very terrible were the grief and the rage of the Emperor
as he looked on him and on the others of his Douzeperes
and on the bodies of that army of twenty thousand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All the field was with blod ouer roun&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Many
a good swerd was broken ther&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Many a fadirles

<p>By the side of Roland, Charlemagne vowed vengeance,
but ere he avenged his death he mourned over
him with infinite anguish:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;The Lord have mercy, Roland, on thy soul!<br /></span>

</div>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg&nbsp;287]</a></span>
A terrible vengeance was the one that he took next
day, when the Saracen army was utterly exterminated;
and when all the noble dead had been buried where
they fell, save only Roland, Oliver, and Turpin, the
bodies of these three heroes were carried to Blaye and
interred with great honour in the great cathedral
there.</p>

<p>Charlemagne then returned to Aix, and as he entered
his palace, Aude the Fair, sister of Oliver, and the
betrothed of Roland, hastened to meet him. Where
were the Douzeperes? What was the moaning murmur
as of women who wept, that had heralded the arrival
in the town of the Emperor and his conquering army?
Eagerly she questioned Charlemagne of the safety of
Roland, and when the Emperor, in pitying grief, told
her:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Roland, thy hero, like a hero died,&rdquo; Aude gave a
bitter cry and fell to the ground like a white lily slain
by a cruel wind. The Emperor thought she had
fainted, but when he would have lifted her up, he found
that she was dead, and, in infinite pity, he had her
taken to Blaye and buried by the side of Roland.</p>

<p>Very tender was Charlemagne to the maiden whom
Roland had loved, but when the treachery of Ganelon
had been proved, for him there was no mercy. At
Aix-la-Chapelle, torn asunder by wild horses, he met a
shameful and a horrible death, nor is his name forgotten
as that of the blackest of traitors. But the memory
of Roland and of the other Douzeperes lives on and is,
however fanciful, forever fragrant.</p>

<h2>THE CHILDREN OF L&Icirc;R</h2>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Silent, O Moyle, be the roar of thy water;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Break not, ye breezes, your chain of repose;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While murmuring mournfully, L&icirc;r&rsquo;s lonely daughter<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tells to the night-star her tale of woes.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Moore.</span></p>


<p>They are the tragedies, not the comedies of the old,
old days that are handed down to us, and the literature
of the Celts is rich in tragedy. To the romantic and
sorrowful imagination of the Celts of the green island
of Erin we owe the hauntingly piteous story of the
children of L&icirc;r.</p>

<p>In the earliest times of all, when Ireland was ruled
by the Dedannans, a people who came from Europe
and brought with them from Greece magic and other
arts so wonderful that the people of the land believed
them to be gods, the Dedannans had so many chiefs
that they met one day to decide who was the best
man of them all, that they might choose him to be
their king. The choice fell upon Bodb the Red, and
gladly did every man acclaim him as king, all save L&icirc;r
of Shee Finnaha, who left the council in great wrath
because he thought that he, and not Bodb, should have
been chosen. In high dudgeon he retired to his own
place, and in the years that followed he and Bodb the
Red waged fierce war against one another. At last a
great sorrow came to L&icirc;r, for after an illness of three
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg&nbsp;290]</a></span>
days his wife, who was very dear to him, was taken from
him by death. Then Bodb saw an opportunity for reconciliation
with the chief whose enemy he had no wish to
be. And to the grief-stricken husband he sent a message:</p>

<p>&ldquo;My heart weeps for thee, yet I pray thee to be
comforted. In my house have I three maidens, my
foster-daughters, the most beautiful and the best instructed
in all Erin. Choose which one thou wilt for
thy wife, and own me for thy lord, and my friendship
shall be thine forever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the message brought comfort to L&icirc;r, and he set
out with a gallant company of fifty chariots, nor ever
halted until he had reached the palace of Bodb the Red
at Lough Derg, on the Shannon. Warm and kindly was
the welcome that L&icirc;r received from his overlord, and
next day, as the three beautiful foster-daughters of Bodb
sat on the same couch as his queen, Bodb said to L&icirc;r:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Behold my three daughters. Choose which one
thou wilt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And L&icirc;r answered, &ldquo;They are all beautiful, but
Eve is the eldest, so she must be the noblest of the three.
I would have her for my wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That day he married Eve, and L&icirc;r took his fair young
wife back with him to his own place, Shee Finnaha, and
happy were both of them in their love. To them in
course of time were born a twin son and a daughter.
The daughter they named Finola and the son Aed, and
the children were as beautiful, as good, and as happy
as their mother. Again she bore twins, boys, whom they
named Ficra and Conn, but as their eyes opened on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg&nbsp;291]</a></span>
the world, the eyes of their mother closed on pleasant
life forever, and once again L&icirc;r was a widower, more bowed
down by grief than before.</p>

<p>The tidings of the death of Eve brought great sorrow
to the palace of Bodb the Red, for to all who knew her
Eve was very dear. But again the king sent a message
of comfort to L&icirc;r:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We sorrow with thee, yet in proof of our friendship
with thee and our love for the one who is gone, we would
give thee another of our daughters to be a mother to the
children who have lost their mother&rsquo;s care.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And again L&icirc;r went to the palace at Loch Derg, the
Great Lake, and there he married Eva, the second of the
foster-daughters of the king.</p>

<p>At first it seemed as if Eva loved her dead sister&rsquo;s
children as though they were her own. But when she
saw how passionate was her husband&rsquo;s devotion to
them, how he would have them to sleep near him and
would rise at their slightest whimper to comfort and to
caress them, and how at dawn she would wake to find
he had left her side to see that all was well with them,
the poisonous weed of jealousy began to grow up in the
garden of her heart. She was a childless woman, and she
knew not whether it was her sister who had borne them
whom she hated, or whether she hated the children
themselves. But steadily the hatred grew, and the love
that Bodb the Red bore for them only embittered her
the more. Many times in the year he would come to
see them, many times would take them away to stay
with him, and each year when the Dedannans held the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg&nbsp;292]</a></span>
Feast of Age&mdash;the feast of the great god Mannanan, of
which those who partook never grew old&mdash;the four
children of L&icirc;r were present, and gave joy to all who
beheld them by their great beauty, their nobility, and
their gentleness.</p>

<p>But as the love that all others gave to the four
children of L&icirc;r grew, the hatred of Eva, their stepmother,
kept pace with it, until at length the poison
in her heart ate into her body as well as her soul, and she
grew worn and ill out of her very wickedness. For
nearly a year she lay sick in bed, while the sound of the
children&rsquo;s laughter and their happy voices, their lovely
faces like the faces of the children of a god, and the
proud and loving words with which their father spoke
of them were, to her, like acid in a festering wound.
At last there came a black day when jealousy had
choked all the flowers of goodness in her heart, and only
treachery and merciless cruelty remained. She rose
from her couch and ordered the horses to be yoked to
her chariot that she might take the four children to
the Great Lake to see the king, her foster-father. They
were but little children, yet the instinct that sometimes
tells even a very little child when it is near an evil thing,
warned Finola that harm would come to her and to
her brothers were they to go. It may also have been,
perhaps, that she had seen, with the sharp vision of a
woman child, the thing to which L&icirc;r was quite blind,
and that in a tone of her stepmother&rsquo;s voice, in a look
she had surprised in her eyes, she had learned that the
love that her father&rsquo;s wife professed for her and for the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg&nbsp;293]</a></span>
others was only hatred, cunningly disguised. Thus
she tried to make excuses for herself and the little brothers
to whom she was a child-mother, so that they need
not go. But Eva listened with deaf ears, and the
children said farewell to L&icirc;r, who must have wondered
at the tears that stood in Finola&rsquo;s eyes and the shadow
that darkened their blue, and drove off in the chariot
with their stepmother.</p>

<p>When they had driven a long way, Eva turned to
her attendants: &ldquo;Much wealth have I,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and
all that I have shall be yours if you will slay for me
those four hateful things that have stolen from me
the love of my man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The servants heard her in horror, and in horror and
shame for her they answered: &ldquo;Fearful is the deed
thou wouldst have us do; more fearful still is it that
thou shouldst have so wicked a thought. Evil will
surely come upon thee for having wished to take the
lives of L&icirc;r&rsquo;s innocent little children.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Angrily, then, she seized a sword and herself would
fain have done what her servants had scorned to do.
But she lacked strength to carry out her own evil
wish, and so they journeyed onwards. They came
to Lake Darvra at last&mdash;now Lough Derravaragh, in
West Meath&mdash;and there they all alighted from the chariot,
and the children, feeling as though they had been
made to play at an ugly game, but that now it was over
and all was safety and happiness again, were sent into
the loch to bathe. Joyously and with merry laughter
the little boys splashed into the clear water by the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg&nbsp;294]</a></span>
rushy shore, all three seeking to hold the hands of their
sister, whose little slim white body was whiter than the
water-lilies and her hair more golden than their hearts.</p>

<p>It was then that Eva struck them, as a snake
strikes its prey. One touch for each, with a magical
wand of the Druids, then the low chanting of an old
old rune, and the beautiful children had vanished, and
where their tiny feet had pressed the sand and their
yellow hair had shown above the water like four daffodil
heads that dance in the wind, there floated four white
swans. But although to Eva belonged the power of
bewitching their bodies, their hearts and souls and speech
still belonged to the children of L&icirc;r. And when Finola
spoke, it was not as a little timid child, but as a woman
who could look with sad eyes into the future and could
there see the terrible punishment of a shameful act.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very evil is the deed that thou hast done,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;We only gave thee love, and we are very young,
and all our days were happiness. By cruelty and
treachery thou hast brought our childhood to an end,
yet is our doom less piteous than thine. Woe, woe unto
thee, O Eva, for a fearful doom lies before thee!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then she asked&mdash;a child still, longing to know when
the dreary days of its banishment from other children
should be over&mdash;&ldquo;Tell us how long a time must pass
until we can take our own forms again.&rdquo;</p>

<span class="caption">ONE TOUCH FOR EACH, WITH A MAGICAL WAND OF THE DRUIDS</span>
</div>

<p>And, relentlessly, Eva made answer: &ldquo;Better had
it been for thy peace hadst thou left unsought that
knowledge. Yet will I tell thee thy doom. Three
hundred years shall ye live in the smooth waters of Lake
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg&nbsp;295]</a></span>
Darvra; three hundred years on the Sea of Moyle,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
which is between Erin and Alba; three hundred years
more at Ivros Domnann<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and at Inis Glora,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> on the
Western Sea. Until a prince from the north shall
marry a princess from the south; until the Tailleken
(St. Patrick) shall come to Erin, and until ye shall hear
the sound of the Christian bell, neither my power nor
thy power, nor the power of any Druid&rsquo;s runes can set
ye free until that weird is dreed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As she spoke, a strange softening came into the
evil woman&rsquo;s heart. They were so still, those white
creatures who gazed up at her with eager, beseeching
eyes, through which looked the souls of the little children
that once she had loved. They were so silent and
piteous, the little Ficra and Conn, whose dimpled baby
faces she often used to kiss. And she said, that her
burden of guilt might be the lighter:</p>

<p>&ldquo;This relief shall ye have in your troubles. Though
ye keep your human reason and your human speech,
yet shall ye suffer no grief because your form is the
form of swans, and you shall sing songs more sweet than
any music that the earth has ever known.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Eva went back to her chariot and drove to the
palace of her foster-father at the Great Lake, and the
four white swans were left on the lonely waters of Darvra.</p>

<p>When she reached the palace without the children,
the king asked in disappointment why she had not
brought them with her.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg&nbsp;296]</a></span>
&ldquo;L&icirc;r loves thee no longer,&rdquo; she made answer. &ldquo;He
will not trust his children to thee, lest thou shouldst work
them some ill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But her father did not believe her lying words.
Speedily he sent messengers to Shee Finnaha that they
might bring back the children who ever carried joy
with them. Amazed, L&icirc;r received the message, and
when he learned that Eva had reached the palace alone,
a terrible dread arose in his heart. In great haste he
set out, and as he passed by Lake Darvra he heard
voices singing melodies so sweet and moving that he
was fain, in spite of his fears, to stop and listen. And
lo, as he listened, he found that the singers were four
swans, that swam close up to where he stood, and
greeted him in the glad voices of his own dear children.
All that night he stayed beside them, and when
they had told him their piteous tale and he knew that
no power could free them till the years of their doom
were accomplished, L&icirc;r&rsquo;s heart was like to break with
pitying love and infinite sorrow. At dawn he took a
tender leave of them and drove to the house of Bodb
the Red. Terrible were the words of L&icirc;r, and dark
was his face as he told the king the evil thing that Eva
had done. And Eva, who had thought in the madness
of her jealousy that L&icirc;r would give her all his love when
he was a childless man, shrank, white and trembling,
away from him when she saw the furious hatred in his
eyes. Then said the king, and his anger was even as the
anger of L&icirc;r:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The suffering of the little children who are dear
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg&nbsp;297]</a></span>
to our souls shall come to an end at last. Thine shall
be an eternal doom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he put her on oath to tell him &ldquo;what shape of
all others, on the earth, or above the earth, or beneath
the earth, she most abhorred, and into which she most
dreaded to be transformed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A demon of the air,&rdquo; answered the cowering woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A demon of the air shalt thou be until time shall
cease!&rdquo; said her foster-father. Thereupon he smote
her with his druidical wand, and a creature too hideous
for men&rsquo;s eyes to look upon, gave a great scream of
anguish, and flapped its black wings as it flew away to
join the other demons of the air.</p>

<p>Then the king of the Dedannans and all his people
went with L&icirc;r to Lake Darvra, and listened to the
honey-sweet melodies that were sung to them by the
white swans that had been the children of their hearts.
And such magic was in the music that it could lull
away all sorrow and pain, and give rest to the grief-stricken
and sleep to the toil-worn and the heavy at
heart. And the Dedannans made a great encampment
on the shores of the lake that they might never be
far from them. There, too, as the centuries went by,
came the Milesians, who succeeded the Dedannans in
Erin, and so for the children of L&icirc;r three hundred years
passed happily away.</p>

<p>Sad for them and for L&icirc;r, and for all the people
of the Dedannans, was the day when the years at
Darvra were ended and the four swans said farewell
to their father and to all who were so dear to them,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg&nbsp;298]</a></span>
spread their snowy pinions, and took flight for the
stormy sea. They sang a song of parting that made
grief sit heavy on the hearts of all those who listened,
and the men of Erin, in memory of the children of L&icirc;r
and of the good things they had wrought by the magic
of their music, made a law, and proclaimed it throughout
all the land, that from that time forth no man of their
land should harm a swan.</p>

<p>Weary were the great white wings of the children
of L&icirc;r when they reached the jagged rocks by the side
of the fierce grey sea of Moyle, whose turbulent waves
fought angrily together. And the days that came to
them there were days of weariness, of loneliness, and
of hardship. Very cold were they often, very hungry,
and yet the sweetness of their song pierced through the
vicious shriek of the tempest and the sullen boom and
crash of the great billows that flung themselves against
the cliffs or thundered in devouring majesty over the
wrack-strewn shore, like a thread of silver that runs
through a pall. One night a tempest drove across and
down the Sea of Moyle from the north-east, and lashed
it into fury. And the mirk darkness and the sleet
that drove in the teeth of the gale like bullets of ice,
and the huge, irresistible breakers that threshed the
shore, filled the hearts of the children of L&icirc;r with dread.
For always they had desired love and beauty, and the
ugliness of unrestrained cruelty and fury made them
sick at soul.</p>

<p>To her brothers Finola said: &ldquo;Beloved ones, of a
surety the storm must drive us apart. Let us, then,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg&nbsp;299]</a></span>
appoint a place of meeting, lest we never look upon
each other again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, knowing that she spoke wisely and well, the
three brothers appointed as their meeting-place the
rock of Carricknarone.</p>

<p>Never did a fiercer storm rage on the sea between
Alba and Erin than the storm that raged that night.
Thunderous, murky clouds blotted out stars and moon,
nor was there any dividing line between sky and sea,
but both churned themselves up together in a passion
of destruction. When the lightning flashed, it showed
only the fury of the cruel seas, the shattered victims
of the destroying storm. Very soon the swans were
driven one from another and scattered over the face
of the angry deep. Scarcely could their souls cling
to their bodies while they struggled with the winds and
waves. When the long, long night came to an end,
in the grey and cheerless dawn Finola swam to the rock
of Carricknarone. But no swans were there, only the
greedy gulls that sought after wreckage, and the terns
that cried very dolorously.</p>

<p>Then great grief came upon Finola, for she feared
she would see her brothers nevermore. But first of
all came Conn, his feathers all battered and broken
and his head drooping, and in a little Ficra appeared,
so drenched and cold and beaten by the winds that no
word could he speak. And Finola took her younger
brothers under her great white wings, and they were
comforted and rested in that warm shelter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If Aed would only come,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;then should
we be happy indeed.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg&nbsp;300]</a></span>
And even as she spoke, they beheld Aed sailing
towards them like a proud ship with its white sails
shining in the sun, and Finola held him close to the snowy
plumage of her breast, and happiness returned to the
children of L&icirc;r.</p>

<p>Many another tempest had they to strive with, and
very cruel to them were the snow and biting frosts
of the dreary winters. One January night there
came a frost that turned even the restless sea into
solid ice, and in the morning, when the swans strove
to rise from the rock of Carricknarone, the iron frost
clung to them and they left behind them the skin of
their feet, the quills of their wings, and the soft feathers
of their breasts, and when the frost had gone, the salt
water was torture for their wounds. Yet ever they sang
their songs, piercing sweet and speaking of the peace
and joy to come, and many a storm-tossed mariner by
them was lulled to sleep and dreamt the happy dreams
of his childhood, nor knew who had sung him so magical
a lullaby. It was in those years that Finola sang the
song which a poet who possessed the wonderful heritage
of a perfect comprehension of the soul of the Gael has
put into English words for us.</p>

<p>Only once during those dreary three hundred years
did the children of L&icirc;r see any of their friends. When
they saw, riding down to the shore at the mouth of the
Bann on the north coast of Erin, a company in gallant
attire, with glittering arms, and mounted on white
horses, the swans hastened to meet them. And glad
were their hearts that day, for the company was led
by two sons of Bodb the Red, who had searched for the
swans along the rocky coast of Erin for many a day,
and who brought them loving greetings from the good
king of the Dedannans and from their father L&icirc;r.</p>

<p>At length the three hundred years on the Sea of Moyle
came to an end, and the swans flew to Ivros Domnann
and the Isle of Glora in the western sea. And there
they had sufferings and hardships to bear that were
even more grievous than those that they had endured
on the Sea of Moyle, and one night the snow that drifted
down upon them from the ice was scourged on by a
north-west wind, and there came a moment when the
three brothers felt that they could endure no more.</p>

<p>But Finola said to them:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the great God of truth who made both land
and sea who alone can succour us, for He alone can
wholly understand the sorrows of our hearts. Put
your trust in Him, dear brothers, and He will send us
comfort and help.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg&nbsp;302]</a></span>
Then said her brothers: &ldquo;In Him we put our trust,&rdquo;
and from that moment the Lord of Heaven gave them
His help, so that no frost, nor snow, nor cold, nor tempest,
nor any of the creatures of the deep could work them
any harm.</p>

<p>When the nine hundred years of their sorrowful
doom had ended, the children of L&icirc;r joyously spread
their wings and flew to their father&rsquo;s home at Shee
Finnaha.</p>

<p>But the house was there no more, for L&icirc;r, their
father, was dead. Only stones, round which grew
rank grass and nettles, and where no human creature
had his habitation, marked the place for which they
had longed with an aching, hungry longing, through
all their weary years of doom. Their cries were piteous
as the cries of lost children as they looked on the desolate
ruins, but all night they stayed there, and their songs
were songs that might have made the very stones shed
tears.</p>

<p>Next day they winged their way back to Inis Glora,
and there the sweetness of their singing drew so many
birds to listen that the little lake got the name of
the Lake of the Bird-Flocks. Near and far, for long
thereafter, flew the swans, all along the coast of the
Western Sea, and at the island of Iniskea they held
converse with the lonely crane that has lived there
since the beginning of the world, and which will live
there until time is no more.</p>

<p>And while the years went by, there came to Erin
one who brought glad tidings, for the holy Patrick came
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg&nbsp;303]</a></span>
to lead men out of darkness into light. With him came
Kemoc, and Kemoc made his home on Inis Glora.</p>

<p>At dawn one morning, the four swans were roused by
the tinkle of a little bell. It was so far away that it
rang faintly, but it was like no sound they had ever
known, and the three brothers were filled with fear and
flew hither and thither, trying to discover from whence
the strange sound came. But when they returned to
Finola, they found her floating at peace on the water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dost not know what sound it is?&rdquo; she asked,
divining their thoughts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We heard a faint, fearful voice,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;but
we know not what it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then said Finola: &ldquo;It is the voice of the Christian
bell. Soon, now, shall our suffering be ended, for such
is the will of God.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So very happily and peacefully they listened to the
ringing of the bell, until Kemoc had said matins. Then
said Finola: &ldquo;Let us now sing our music,&rdquo; and they
praised the Lord of heaven and earth.</p>

<p>And when the wonderful melody of their song reached
the ears of Kemoc, he knew that none but the children
of L&icirc;r could make such magic-sweet melody. So he
hastened to where they were, and when he asked them if
they were indeed the children of L&icirc;r, for whose sake he had
come to Inis Glora, they told him all their piteous tale.</p>

<p>Then said Kemoc, &ldquo;Come then to land, and put your
trust in me, for on this island shall your enchantment
come to an end.&rdquo; And when most gladly they came, he
caused a cunning workman to fashion two slender silver
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg&nbsp;304]</a></span>
chains; one he put between Finola and Aed, and the other
between Ficra and Conn, and so joyous were they to know
again human love, and so happy to join each day with
Kemoc in praising God, that the memory of their suffering
and sorrow lost all its bitterness. Thus in part
were the words of Eva fulfilled, but there had yet to
take place the entire fulfilment of her words.</p>

<p>Decca, a princess of Munster, had wed Larguen, king
of Connaught, and when news came to her of the wonderful
swans of Kemoc, nothing would suffice her but that
she should have them for her own. By constant beseeching,
she at length prevailed upon Larguen to send
messengers to Kemoc, demanding the swans. When
the messengers returned with a stern refusal from
Kemoc, the king was angry indeed. How dared a
mere cleric refuse to gratify the whim of the queen of
Larguen of Connaught! To Inis Glora he went, posthaste,
himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it truth that ye have dared to refuse a gift of
your birds to my queen?&rdquo; he asked, in wrath.</p>

<p>And Kemoc answered: &ldquo;It is truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Larguen, in furious anger, seized hold of the
silver chain that bound Finola and Aed together, and
of the chain by which Conn and Ficra were bound, and
dragged them away from the altar by which they sat,
that he might take them to his queen.</p>

<p>But as the king held their chains in his rude grasp,
a wondrous thing took place.</p>

<p>Instead of swans, there followed Larguen a very old
woman, white-haired and feeble, and three very old men,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg&nbsp;305]</a></span>
bony and wrinkled and grey. And when Larguen beheld
them, terror came upon him and he hastened homeward,
followed by the bitter denunciations of Kemoc. Then
the children of L&icirc;r, in human form at last, turned to
Kemoc and besought him to baptize them, because they
knew that death was very near.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thou art not more sorrowful at parting from us
than we are to part with you, dear Kemoc,&rdquo; they said.
And Finola said, &ldquo;Bury us, I pray you, together.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="poem">

<span class="i0">&ldquo;As oft in life my brothers dear<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Were sooth&rsquo;d by me to rest&mdash;<br /></span>

<p>So Kemoc signed them in Holy Baptism with the
blessed Cross, and even as the water touched their
foreheads, and while his words were in their ears, death
took them. And, as they passed, Kemoc looked up,
and, behold, four beautiful children, their faces radiant
with joy, and with white wings lined with silver, flying
upwards to the clouds. And soon they vanished from
his sight and he saw them no more.</p>

<p>He buried them as Finola had wished, and raised a
mound over them, and carved their names on a stone.</p>

<p>And over it he sang a lament and prayed to the God
of all love and purity, a prayer for the pure and loving
souls of those who had been the children of L&icirc;r.</p>

<p>who is known to the Celts of Scotland as Darthool, to
those of Ireland as Deirdr&ecirc;. As in the story of Helen,
it is not easy, or even possible in the story of Deirdr&ecirc;,
to disentangle the old, old facts of actual history from
the web of romantic fairy tale that time has woven
about them, yet so great is the power of Deirdr&ecirc;, even

<p>In many ancient manuscripts we get the story in
more or less complete form. In the Advocates&rsquo; Library

and the fullest version, while the oldest and the shortest

But those who would revel in the old tale and have
Deirdr&ecirc; lead them by the hand into the enchanted
realm of the romance of misty, ancient days of our
Western Isles must go for help to Fiona Macleod, to
Alexander Carmichael, to Lady Gregory, to Dr. Douglas
Hyde, to W. F. Skene, to W. B. Yeats, to J. M. Synge,
and to those others who, like true descendants of the
Druids, possess the power of unlocking the entrance
gates of the Green Islands of the Blest.</p>

<p>Conchubar, or Conor, ruled the kingdom of the
Ultonians, now Ulster, when Deirdr&ecirc; was born in Erin.
All the most famous warriors of his time, heroes whose
mighty deeds live on in legend, and whose title was
&ldquo;The Champions of the Red Branch,&rdquo; he gathered
round him, and all through Erin and Alba rang the
fame of the warlike Ultonians.</p>

<p>There came a day when Conor and his champions, gorgeous
in their gala dress of crimson tunic with brooches of
inlaid gold and white-hooded shirt embroidered in red
gold, went to a feast in the house of one called Felim.
Felim was a bard, and because not only was his arm in
war strong and swift to strike, but because, in peace, his
fingers could draw the sweetest of music from his harp,
he was dear to the king. As they feasted, Conor beheld
a dark shadow of horror and of grief fall on the face of
Cathbad, a Druid who had come in his train, and saw
that his aged eyes were gazing far into the Unseen.
Speedily he bade him tell him what evil thing it was that
he saw, and Cathbad turned to the childless Felim and
told him that to his wife there was about to be born a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg&nbsp;308]</a></span>
daughter, with eyes like stars that are mirrored by night
in the water, with lips red as the rowan berries and teeth
more white than pearls; with a voice more sweet than the
music of fairy harps. &ldquo;A maiden fair, tall, long haired,
for whom champions will contend ... and mighty
kings be envious of her lovely, faultless form.&rdquo; For her
sweet sake, he said, more blood should be spilt in Erin
than for generations and ages past, and many heroes
and bright torches of the Gaels should lose their lives.
For love of her, three heroes of eternal renown must
give their lives away, the sea in which her starry eyes
should mirror themselves would be a sea of blood, and
woe unutterable should come on the sons of Erin.
Then up spoke the lords of the Red Branch, and grimly
they looked at Felim the Harper:</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the babe that thy wife is about to bear is to
bring such evil upon our land, better that thou shouldst
shed her innocent blood ere she spills the blood of our
nation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Felim made answer:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is well spoken. Bitter it is for my wife and for
me to lose a child so beautiful, yet shall I slay her that
my land may be saved from such a doom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Conor, the king, spoke then, and because the
witchery of the perfect beauty and the magic charm of
Deirdr&ecirc; was felt by him even before she was born, he
said: &ldquo;She shall not die. Upon myself I take the
doom. The child shall be kept apart from all men
until she is of an age to wed. Then shall I take her for
my wife, and none shall dare to contend for her.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg&nbsp;309]</a></span>
His voice had barely ceased, when a messenger
came to Felim to tell him that a daughter was born to
him, and on his heels came a procession of chanting
women, bearing the babe on a flower-decked cushion.
And all who saw the tiny thing, with milk-white skin,
and locks &ldquo;more yellow than the western gold of the
summer sun,&rdquo; looked on her with the fear that even
the bravest heart feels on facing the Unknown. And
Cathbad spoke: &ldquo;Let Deirdr&ecirc; be her name, sweet
menace that she is.&rdquo; And the babe gazed up with starry
eyes at the white-haired Druid as he chanted to her:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;<i>Many will be jealous of your face, O flame of beauty; for your sake
heroes shall go to exile. For there is harm in your face; it will bring banishment
and death on the sons of kings. In your fate, O beautiful child, are
wounds and ill-doings, and shedding of blood.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>You will have a little grave apart to yourself; you will be a tale of wonder
for ever, Deirdr&ecirc;.</i>&rdquo;</p></div>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Lady Gregory&rsquo;s Translation.</span></p>

<p>As Conor commanded, Deirdr&ecirc;, the little &ldquo;babe
of destiny,&rdquo; was left with her mother for only a month
and a day, and then was sent with a nurse and with
Cathbad the Druid to a lonely island, thickly wooded,
and only accessible by a sort of causeway at low tide.
Here she grew into maidenhood, and each day became
more fair. She had instruction from Cathbad in religion
and in all manner of wisdom, and it would seem
as though she also learned from him some of that mystical
power that enabled her to see things hidden from
human eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; one day she asked her teacher, &ldquo;who
made the stars, the firmament above, the earth, the
flowers, both thee and me?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg&nbsp;310]</a></span>
And Cathbad answered: &ldquo;God. But who God is,
alas! no man can say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Deirdr&ecirc;, an impetuous child, seized the druidical
staff from the hand of Cathbad, broke it in two,
and flung the pieces far out on the water. &ldquo;Ah, Cathbad!&rdquo;
she cried, &ldquo;there shall come One in the dim future
for whom all your Druid spells and charms are naught.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then seeing Cathbad hang his head, and a tear
trickle down his face, for he knew that the child spoke
truth, the child, grieved at giving pain to the friend
whom she loved, threw her arms about the old man&rsquo;s
neck, and by her kisses strove to comfort him.</p>

<p>As Deirdr&ecirc; grew older, Conor sent one from his court
to educate her in all that any queen should know. They
called her the Lavarcam, which, in our tongue, really
means the Gossip, and she was one of royal blood who
belonged to a class that in those days had been trained
to be chroniclers, or story-tellers. The Lavarcam was
a clever woman, and she marvelled at the wondrous
beauty of the child she came to teach, and at her equally
marvellous mind.</p>

<p>One winter day, when the snow lay deep, it came to
pass that Deirdr&ecirc; saw lying on the snow a calf that had
been slain for her food. The red blood that ran from
its neck had brought a black raven swooping down
upon the snow. And to Lavarcam Deirdr&ecirc; said: &ldquo;If
there were a man who had hair of the blackness of that
raven, skin of the whiteness of the snow, and cheeks as
red as the blood that stains its whiteness, to him should
I give my heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg&nbsp;311]</a></span>
And Lavarcam, without thought, made answer:</p>

<p>&ldquo;One I know whose skin is whiter than the snow,
whose cheeks are ruddy as the blood that stained the
snow, and whose hair is black and glossy as the raven&rsquo;s
wing. He has eyes of the darkest blue of the sky, and
head and shoulders is he above all the men of Erin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what will be the name of that man, Lavarcam?&rdquo;
asked Deirdr&ecirc;. &ldquo;And whence is he, and what
his degree?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Lavarcam made answer that he of whom she
spoke was Naoise, one of the three sons of Usna, a great
lord of Alba, and that these three sons were mighty
champions who had been trained at the famed military
school at Sgathaig<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> in the Isle of Skye.</p>

<p>Then said Deirdr&ecirc;: &ldquo;My love shall be given to
none but Naoise, son of Usna. To him shall it belong
forever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From that day forward, Naoise held kingship over
the thoughts and dreams of Deirdr&ecirc;.</p>

<p>And when Lavarcam saw how deep her careless
words had sunk into the heart of the maiden, she grew
afraid, and tried to think of a means by which to
undo the harm which, in her thoughtlessness, she had
wrought.</p>

<p>Now Conor had made a law that none but Cathbad,
Lavarcam, and the nurse of Deirdr&ecirc; should pass through
the forest that led to her hiding-place, and that none
but they should look upon her until his own eyes beheld
her and he took her for his wife. But as Lavarcam
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg&nbsp;312]</a></span>
one day came from seeing Deirdr&ecirc;, and from listening
to her many eager questions about Naoise, she met a
swineherd, rough in looks and speech, and clad in the
pelt of a deer, and with him two rough fellows, bondmen
of the Ultonians, and to her quick mind there
came a plan. Thus she bade them follow her into the
forbidden forest and there to remain, by the side of a
well, until they should hear the bark of a fox and the
cry of a jay. Then they were to walk slowly on through
the woods, speaking to none whom they might meet,
and still keeping silence when they were again out of the
shadow of the trees.</p>

<p>Then Lavarcam sped back to Deirdr&ecirc; and begged
her to come with her to enjoy the beauty of the woods.
In a little, Lavarcam strayed away from her charge, and
soon the cry of a jay and the bark of a fox were heard,
and while Deirdr&ecirc; still marvelled at the sounds that
came so close together, Lavarcam returned. Nor had
she been back a minute before three men came through
the trees and slowly walked past, close to where
Lavarcam and Deirdr&ecirc; were hidden.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have never seen men so near before,&rdquo; said
Deirdr&ecirc;. &ldquo;Only from the outskirts of the forest have
I seen them very far away. Who are these men, who
bring no joy to my eyes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Lavarcam made answer: &ldquo;These are Naoise,
Ardan, and Ainle&mdash;the three sons of Usna.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Deirdr&ecirc; looked hard at Lavarcam, and scorn and
laughter were in her merry eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then shall I have speech with Naoise, Ardan, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg&nbsp;313]</a></span>
Ainle,&rdquo; she said, and ere Lavarcam could stop her,
she had flitted through the trees by a path amongst
the fern, and stood suddenly before the three men.</p>

<p>And the rough hinds, seeing such perfect loveliness,
made very sure that Deirdr&ecirc; was one of the <i>sidhe</i><a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
and stared at her with the round eyes and gaping mouths
of wondering terror.</p>

<p>For a moment Deirdr&ecirc; gazed at them. Then:
&ldquo;Are ye the Sons of Usna?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>And when they stood like stocks, frightened and
stupid, she lashed them with her mockery, until the
swineherd could no more, and blurted out the whole
truth to this most beautiful of all the world. Then,
very gently, like pearls from a silver string, the words
fell from the rowan-red lips of Deirdr&ecirc;: &ldquo;I blame thee
not, poor swineherd,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and that thou mayst
know that I deem thee a true man, I would fain ask
thee to do one thing for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And when the eyes of the herd met the eyes of
Deirdr&ecirc;, a soul was born in him, and he knew things
of which he never before had dreamed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I can do one thing to please thee, that will I
do,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Aye, and gladly pay for it with my
life. Thenceforth my life is thine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Deirdr&ecirc; said: &ldquo;I would fain see Naoise, one of
the Sons of Usna.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And once more the swineherd said: &ldquo;My life is
thine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Deirdr&ecirc;, seeing in his eyes a very beautiful
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg&nbsp;314]</a></span>
thing, stooped and kissed the swineherd on his weather-beaten,
tanned forehead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go, then,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to Naoise. Tell him that I,
Deirdr&ecirc;, dream of him all the night and think of him all
the day, and that I bid him meet me here to-morrow an
hour before the setting of the sun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The swineherd watched her flit into the shadows
of the trees, and then went on his way, through the
snowy woods, that he might pay with his life for the kiss
that Deirdr&ecirc; had given him.</p>

<p>Sorely puzzled was Lavarcam over the doings of
Deirdr&ecirc; that day, for Deirdr&ecirc; told her not a word of what
had passed between her and the swineherd. On the
morrow, when she left her to go back to the court of
King Conor, she saw, as she drew near Emain Macha,
where he stayed, black wings that flapped over something
that lay on the snow. At her approach there rose
three ravens, three kites, and three hoodie-crows, and
she saw that their prey was the body of the swineherd
with gaping spear-wounds all over him. Yet even
then he looked happy. He had died laughing, and there
was still a smile on his lips. Faithfully had he delivered
his message, and when he had spoken of the beauty
of Deirdr&ecirc;, rumour of his speech had reached the king,
and the spears of Conor&rsquo;s men had enabled him to make
true the words he had said to Deirdr&ecirc;: &ldquo;I will pay for it
with my life.&rdquo; In this way was shed the first blood of
that great sea of blood that was spilt for the love of
Deirdr&ecirc;, the Beauty of the World.</p>

<p>From where the swineherd lay, Lavarcam went to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg&nbsp;315]</a></span>
the camp of the Sons of Usna, and to Naoise she told
the story of the love that Deirdr&ecirc; bore him, and counselled
him to come to the place where she was hidden,
and behold her beauty. And Naoise, who had seen
how even a rough clod of a hind could achieve the
noble chivalry of a race of kings for her dear sake, felt
his heart throb within him. &ldquo;I will come,&rdquo; he said to
Lavarcam.</p>

<p>Days passed, and Deirdr&ecirc; waited, very sure that
Naoise must come to her at last. And one day she
heard a song of magical sweetness coming through the
trees. Three voices sung the song, and it was as though
one of the <i>sidhe</i> played a harp to cast a spell upon men.
The voice of Ainle, youngest of the Sons of Usna, was
like the sweet upper strings of the harp, that of Ardan
the strings in the middle, and the voice of Naoise was like
the strings whose deep resonance can play upon the
hearts of warriors and move them to tears. Then Deirdr&ecirc;
knew that she heard the voice of her beloved, and
she sped to him as a bird speeds to her mate. Even as
Lavarcam had told her was Naoise, eldest of the Sons of
Usna, but no words had been able to tell Naoise of the
beauty of Deirdr&ecirc;.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;It was as though a sudden flood of sunshine burst forth in that
place. For a woman came from the thicket more beautiful than any
dream he had ever dreamed. She was clad in a saffron robe over white
that was like the shining of the sun on foam of the sea, and this was
claspt with great bands of yellow gold, and over her shoulders was the
rippling flood of her hair, the sprays of which lightened into delicate
fire, and made a mist before him, in the which he could see her eyes
like two blue pools wherein purple shadows dreamed.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Fiona Macleod.</span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg&nbsp;316]</a></span>
From that moment Naoise &ldquo;gave his love to Deirdr&ecirc;
above every other creature,&rdquo; and their souls rushed
together and were one for evermore. It was for them
the beginning of a perfect love, and so sure were they of
that love from the very first moment that it seemed
as though they must have been born loving one another.</p>

<p>Of that love they talked, of the anger of Conor when
he knew that his destined bride was the love of Naoise,
and together they planned how it was best for Deirdr&ecirc;
to escape from the furious wrath of the king who desired
her for his own.</p>

<p>Of a sudden, the hands of Naoise gripped the iron-pointed
javelin that hung by his side, and drove it
into a place where the snow weighed down the bracken.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it a wolf?&rdquo; cried Deirdr&ecirc;.</p>

<p>And Naoise made answer: &ldquo;Either a dead man,
or the mark of where a man has lain hidden thou wilt
find under the bracken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And when they went to look they found, like the
clap of a hare, the mark of where a man had lain hidden,
and close beside the javelin that was driven in the
ground there lay a wooden-hilted knife.</p>

<p>Then said Naoise: &ldquo;Well I knew that Conor would
set a spy on my tracks. Come with me now, Deirdr&ecirc;,
else may I lose thee forever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And with a glad heart Deirdr&ecirc; went with him who
was to be her lord, and Naoise took her to where his brothers
awaited his coming. To Deirdr&ecirc;, both Ainle and
Ardan swiftly gave their lifelong allegiance and their
love, but they were full of forebodings for her and for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg&nbsp;317]</a></span>
Naoise because of the certain wrath of Conor, the
king.</p>

<p>Then said Naoise: &ldquo;Although harm should come,
for her dear sake I am willing to live in disgrace for the
rest of my days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Ardan and Ainle made answer: &ldquo;Of a certainty,
evil will be of it, yet though there be, thou shalt not
be under disgrace as long as we shall be alive. We will
go with her to another country. There is not in Erin
a king who will not bid us welcome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then did the Sons of Usna decide to cross the Sea
of Moyle, and in their own land of Alba to find a happy
sanctuary. That night they fled, and with them took
three times fifty men, three times fifty women, three
times fifty horses, and three times fifty greyhounds.
And when they looked back to where they had had their
dwelling, they saw red flames against the deep blue
sky of the night, and knew that the vengeance of Conor
had already begun. And first they travelled round
Erin from Essa to Beinn Etair,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> and then in a great
black galley they set sail, and Deirdr&ecirc; had a heart light
as the white-winged sea-birds as the men pulled at the
long oars and sang together a rowing song, and she
leaned on the strong arm of Naoise and saw the blue
coast-line of Erin fading into nothingness.</p>

<p>In the bay of Aros, on the eastern shores of the
island of Mull, they found their first resting-place,
but there they feared treachery from a lord of Appin.
For the starry eyes of Deirdr&ecirc; were swift to discern evil
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg&nbsp;318]</a></span>
that the eyes of the Sons of Usna could not see. Thus
they fared onward until they reached the great sea-loch
of Etive, with hills around it, and Ben Cruachan, its head
in mist, towering above it like a watchman placed
there by Time, to wait and to watch over the people
of those silent hills and lonely glens until Time should
give place to his brother, Eternity.</p>

<p>Joy was in the hearts of the three Sons of Usna when
they came back to the home of their fathers. Usna
was dead, but beyond the Falls of Lora was still the great
dun&mdash;the vitrified fort&mdash;which he had built for himself
and for those who should follow him.</p>

<p>For Deirdr&ecirc; then began a time of perfect happiness.
Naoise was her heart, but very dear to her also were
the brothers of Naoise, and each of the three vied with
one another in their acts of tender and loving service.
Their thrice fifty vassals had no love for Alba, and rejoiced
when their lord, Naoise, allowed them to return
to Erin, but the Sons of Usna were glad to have none
to come between them and their serving of Deirdr&ecirc;,
the queen of their hearts. Soon she came to know
well each little bay, each beach, and each little lonely
glen of Loch Etive, for the Sons of Usna did not always
stay at the dun which had been their father&rsquo;s, but went
a-hunting up the loch. At various spots on the shores
of Etive they had camping places, and at Dail-an-eas<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
they built for Deirdr&ecirc; a sunny bower.</p>

<p>On a sloping bank above the waterfall they built the
little nest, thatched with the royal fern of the mountains,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg&nbsp;319]</a></span>
the red clay of the pools, and with soft feathers from the
breasts of birds. There she could sit and listen to the
murmur and drip of the clear water over the mossy
boulders, the splash of the salmon in the dark pools, and
see the distant silver of the loch. When the summer sun
was hot on the bog myrtle and heather, the hum of the
wild bees would lull her to sleep, and in autumn, when
the bracken grew red and golden and the rowan berries
grew red as Deirdr&ecirc;&rsquo;s lips, her keen eyes would see the
stags grazing high up among the grey boulders of the
mist-crowned mountains, and would warn the brothers
of the sport awaiting them. The crow of the grouse,
the belling of stags, the bark of the hill-fox, the swish
of the great wings of the golden eagle, the song of birds,
the lilt of running water, the complaining of the wind
through the birches&mdash;all these things made music to
Deirdr&ecirc;, to whom all things were dear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Is tu mein na Dearshul agha</i>&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The tenderness of
heartsweet Deirdr&ecirc;&rdquo;&mdash;so runs a line in an old, old Gaelic
verse, and it is always of her tenderness as well as her
beauty that the old <i>Oea</i> speak.</p>

<p>Sometimes she would hunt the red deer with Naoise
and his brothers, up the lonely glens, up through the
clouds to the silent mountain tops, and in the evening,
when she was weary, her three loyal worshippers would
proudly bear her home upon their bucklers.</p>

<p>So the happy days passed away, and in Erin the
angry heart of Conor grew yet more angry when tidings
came to him of the happiness of Deirdr&ecirc; and the Sons of
Usna. Rumour came to him that the king of Alba
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg&nbsp;320]</a></span>
had planned to come against Naoise, to slay him, and
to take Deirdr&ecirc; for his wife, but that ere he could come
the Sons of Usna and Deirdr&ecirc; had sailed yet further
north in their galley, and that there, in the land of his
mother, Naoise ruled as a king. And not only on Loch
Etive, but on Loch Awe and Loch Fyne, Loch Striven,
Loch Ard, Loch Long, Loch Lomond and all along the
sea-loch coast, the fame of the Sons of Usna spread, and
the wonder of the beauty of Deirdr&ecirc;, fairest of women.</p>

<p>And ever the hatred of Conor grew, until one day
there came into his mind a plan of evil by which his
burning thirst for revenge might be handsomely assuaged.</p>

<p>He made, therefore, a great feast, at which all the
heroes of the Red Branch were present. When he had
done them every honour, he asked them if they were
content. As one man: &ldquo;Well content indeed!&rdquo; answered
they.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that is what I am not,&rdquo; said the king. Then
with the guile of fair words he told them that to him
it was great sorrow that the three heroes, with whose
deeds the Western Isles and the whole of the north and
west of Alba were ringing, should not be numbered
amongst his friends, sit at his board in peace and amity,
and fight for the Ultonians like all the other heroes of
the Red Branch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They took from me the one who would have been
my wife,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;yet even that I can forgive, and if
they would return to Erin, glad would my welcome be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At these words there was great rejoicing amongst
the lords of the Red Branch and all those who listened,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg&nbsp;321]</a></span>
and Conor, glad at heart, said, &ldquo;My three best champions
shall go to bring them back from their exile,&rdquo;
and he named Conall the Victorious, Cuchulainn, and
Fergus, the son of Rossa the Red. Then secretly he
called Conall to him and asked him what he would do
if he were sent to fetch the Sons of Usna, and, in spite
of his safe-conduct, they were slain when they reached
the land of the Ultonians. And Conall made answer
that should such a shameful thing come to pass he
would slay with his own hand all the traitor dogs. Then
he sent for Cuchulainn, and to him put the same
question, and, in angry scorn, the young hero replied
that even Conor himself would not be safe from his
vengeance were such a deed of black treachery to be
performed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well did I know thou didst bear me no love,&rdquo;
said Conor, and black was his brow.</p>

<p>He called for Fergus then, and Fergus, sore troubled,
made answer that were there to be such a betrayal, the
king alone would be held sacred from his vengeance.</p>

<p>Then Conor gladly gave Fergus command to go to
Alba as his emissary, and to fetch back with him the three
brothers and Deirdr&ecirc; the Beautiful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thy name of old was Honeymouth,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;so
I know well that with guile thou canst bring them to
Erin. And when thou shalt have returned with them,
send them forward, but stay thyself at the house of
Borrach. Borrach shall have warning of thy coming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This he said, because to Fergus and to all the other
of the Red Branch, a <i>geasa</i>, or pledge, was sacrosanct.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg&nbsp;322]</a></span>
And well he knew that Fergus had as one of his
<i>geasa</i> that he would never refuse an invitation to a
feast.</p>

<p>Next day Fergus and his two sons, Illann the Fair
and Buinne the Red, set out in their galley for the dun
of the Sons of Usna on Loch Etive.</p>

<p>The day before their hurried flight from Erin, Ainle
and Ardan had been playing chess in their dun with
Conor, the king. The board was of fair ivory, and the
chessmen were of red-gold, wrought in strange devices.
It had come from the mysterious East in years far beyond
the memory of any living man, and was one of the
dearest of Conor&rsquo;s possessions. Thus, when Ainle and
Ardan carried off the chess-board with them in their flight,
after the loss of Deirdr&ecirc;, that was the loss that gave the
king the greatest bitterness. Now it came to pass that
as Naoise and Deirdr&ecirc; were sitting in front of their dun,
the little waves of Loch Etive lapping up on the seaweed,
yellow as the hair of Deirdr&ecirc;, far below, and playing
chess at this board, they heard a shout from the
woods down by the shore where the hazels and birches
grew thick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is the voice of a man of Erin!&rdquo; said Naoise,
and stopped in his game to listen.</p>

<p>But Deirdr&ecirc; said, very quickly: &ldquo;Not so! It is the
voice of a Gael of Alba.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yet so she spoke that she might try to deceive her
own heart, that even then was chilled by the black
shadow of an approaching evil. Then came another
shout, and yet a third. And when they heard the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg&nbsp;323]</a></span>
third shout, there was no doubt left in their minds, for
they all knew the voice for that of Fergus, the son of
Rossa the Red. And when Ardan hastened down to
the harbour to greet him, Deirdr&ecirc; confessed to Naoise
why she had refused at first to own that it was a voice
from Erin that she heard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw in a dream last night,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;three birds
that flew hither from Emain Macha, carrying three
sips of honey in their beaks. The honey they left with
us, but took away three sips of blood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Naoise said: &ldquo;What then, best beloved, dost
thou read from this dream of thine?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Deirdr&ecirc; said: &ldquo;I read that Fergus comes from
Conor with honeyed words of peace, but behind his
treacherous words lies death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As they spake, Ardan and Fergus and his following
climbed up the height where the bog-myrtle and the
heather and sweet fern yielded their sweetest incense
as they were wounded under their firm tread.</p>

<p>And when Fergus stood before Deirdr&ecirc; and Naoise,
the man of her heart, he told them of Conor&rsquo;s message,
and of the peace and the glory that awaited them in
Erin if they would but listen to the words of welcome
that he brought.</p>

<p>Then said Naoise: &ldquo;I am ready.&rdquo; But his eyes
dared not meet the sea-blue eyes of Deirdr&ecirc;, his queen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Knowest thou that my pledge is one of honour?&rdquo;
asked Fergus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it well,&rdquo; said Naoise.</p>

<p>So in joyous feasting was that night spent, and only
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg&nbsp;324]</a></span>
over the heart of Deirdr&ecirc; hung that black cloud of sorrow
to come, of woe unspeakable.</p>

<p>When the golden dawn crept over the blue hills of
Loch Etive, and the white-winged birds of the sea
swooped and dived and cried in the silver waters, the
galley of the Sons of Usna set out to sea.</p>

<p>And Deirdr&ecirc;, over whom hung a doom she had not
the courage to name, sang a song at parting:</p>

<p class="author"><i>Translated by</i> <span class="smcap">W. F. Skene</span>, LL.D.</p>

<p>Thus they fared across the grey-green sea betwixt
Alba and Erin, and when Ardan and Ainle and Naoise
heard the words of the song of Deirdr&ecirc;, on their hearts
also descended the strange sorrow of an evil thing from
which no courage could save them.</p>

<p>At Ballycastle, opposite Rathlin Island, where a
rock on the shore (&ldquo;Carraig Uisneach&rdquo;) still bears
the name of the Sons of Usna, Fergus and the returned
exiles landed. And scarcely were they out of sight of
the shore when a messenger came to Fergus, bidding
him to a feast of ale at the dun of Borrach. Then
Fergus, knowing well that in this was the hand of Conor
and that treachery was meant, reddened all over with
anger and with shame. But yet he dared not break
his <i>geasa</i>, even although by holding to it the honour he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg&nbsp;326]</a></span>
had pledged to the three brothers for their safe-conduct
and that of Deirdr&ecirc; was dragged through the mire.
He therefore gave them his sons for escort and went
to the feast at the dun of Borrach, full well knowing
that Deirdr&ecirc; spoke truth when she told him sadly that
he had sold his honour. The gloomy forebodings that
had assailed the heart of Deirdr&ecirc; ere they had left Loch
Etive grew ever the stronger as they went southwards.
She begged Naoise to let them go to some place of safety
and there wait until Fergus had fulfilled his <i>geasa</i> and
could rejoin them and go with them to Emain Macha.
But the Sons of Usna, strong in the knowledge of their
own strength, and simply trustful of the pledged word
of Conor and of Fergus, laughed at her fears, and continued
on their way. Dreams of dread portent haunted
her sleep, and by daytime her eyes in her white face
looked like violets in the snow. She saw a cloud of
blood always hanging over the beautiful Sons of Usna,
and all of them she saw, and Illann the Fair, with their
heads shorn off, gory and awful. Yet no pleading words
could prevail upon Naoise. His fate drove him on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To Emain Macha we must go, my beloved,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;To do other than this would be to show that
we have fear, and fear we have none.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus at last did they arrive at Emain Macha, and
with courteous welcome Conor sent them word that the
house of the heroes of the Red Branch was to be theirs
that night. And although the place the king had
chosen for their lodgment confirmed all the intuitions
and forebodings of Deirdr&ecirc;, the evening was spent by in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg&nbsp;327]</a></span>
good cheer, and Deirdr&ecirc; had the joy of a welcome there
from her old friend Lavarcam. For to Lavarcam Conor
had said: &ldquo;I would have thee go to the House of the
Red Branch and bring me back tidings if the beauty
of Deirdr&ecirc; has waned, or if she is still the most beautiful
of all women.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And when Lavarcam saw her whom she had loved
as a little child, playing chess with her husband at the
board of ivory and gold, she knew that love had made
the beauty of Deirdr&ecirc; blossom, and that she was now
more beautiful than the words of any man or woman
could tell. Nor was it possible for her to be a tool for
Conor when she looked in the starry eyes of Deirdr&ecirc;,
and so she poured forth warning of the treachery of
Conor, and the Sons of Usna knew that there was truth
in the dreams of her who was the queen of their hearts.
And even as Lavarcam ceased there came to the eyes of
Deirdr&ecirc; a vision such as that of Cathbad the Druid on
the night of her birth.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;I see three torches quenched this night,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And
these three torches are the Three Torches of Valour among the
Gael, and their names are the names of the Sons of Usna. And more
bitter still is this sorrow, because that the Red Branch shall ultimately
perish through it, and Uladh itself be overthrown, and blood fall this
way and that as the whirled rains of winter.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Fiona Macleod.</span></p>

<p>Then Lavarcam went her way, and returned to the
palace at Emain Macha and told Conor that the cruel
winds and snows of Alba had robbed Deirdr&ecirc; of all her
loveliness, so that she was no more a thing to be desired.
But Naoise had said to Deirdr&ecirc; when she foretold his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg&nbsp;328]</a></span>
doom: &ldquo;Better to die for thee and for thy deathless
beauty than to have lived without knowledge of thee
and thy love,&rdquo; and it may have been that some memory
of the face of Deirdr&ecirc;, when she heard these words,
dwelt in the eyes of Lavarcam and put quick suspicion
into the evil heart of the king. For when Lavarcam had
gone forth, well pleased that she had saved her darling,
Conor sent a spy&mdash;a man whose father and three brothers
had fallen in battle under the sword of Naoise&mdash;that he
might see Deirdr&ecirc; and confirm or contradict the report
of Lavarcam. And when this man reached the house
of the Red Branch, he found that the Sons of Usna
had been put on their guard, for all the doors and windows
were barred. Thus he climbed to a narrow upper
window and peered in. There, lying on the couches,
the chess-board of ivory and gold between them, were
Naoise and Deirdr&ecirc;. So beautiful were they, that they
were as the deathless gods, and as they played that last
game of their lives, they spoke together in low voices of
love that sounded like the melody of a harp in the hands
of a master player. Deirdr&ecirc; was the first to see the
peering face with the eyes that gloated on her loveliness.
No word said she, but silently made the gaze of Naoise
follow her own, even as he held a golden chessman in
his hand, pondering a move. Swift as a stone from a
sling the chessman was hurled, and the man fell back to
the ground with his eyeball smashed, and found his
way to Emain Macha as best he could, shaking with
agony and snarling with lust for revenge. Vividly he
painted for the king the picture of the most beautiful
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg&nbsp;329]</a></span>
woman on earth as she played at the chess-board that
he held so dear, and the rage of Conor that had smouldered
ever since that day when he learned that Naoise
had stolen Deirdr&ecirc; from him, flamed up into madness.
With a bellow like that of a wounded bull, he called
upon the Ultonians to come with him to the House of
the Red Branch, to burn it down, and to slay all those
within it with the sword, save only Deirdr&ecirc;, who was to
be saved for a more cruel fate.</p>

<p>In the House of the Red Branch, Deirdr&ecirc; and the three
brothers and the two sons of Fergus heard the shouts of
the Ultonians and knew that the storm was about to
break. But, calm as rocks against which the angry
waves beat themselves in vain, sat those whose portion
at dawn was to be cruel death. And Naoise and Ainle
played chess, with hands that did not tremble. At the
first onslaught, Buinne the Red, son of Fergus, sallied
forth, quenched the flames, and drove back the Ultonians
with great slaughter. But Conor called to him to
parley and offered him a bribe of land, and Buinne,
treacherous son of a treacherous father, went over to
the enemy. His brother, Illann the Fair, filled with
shame, did what he could to make amends. He went
forth, and many hundreds of the besieging army fell
before him, ere death stayed his loyal hand. At his
death the Ultonians again fired the house, and first
Ardan and then Ainle left their chess for a fiercer game,
and glutted their sword blades with the blood of their
enemies. Last came the turn of Naoise. He kissed
Deirdr&ecirc;, and drank a drink, and went out against the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg&nbsp;330]</a></span>
men of Conor, and where his brothers had slain hundreds,
a thousand fell before his sword.</p>

<p>Then fear came into the heart of Conor, for he foresaw
that against the Sons of Usna no man could prevail,
save by magic. Thus he sent for Cathbad the
Druid, who was even then very near death, and the
old man was carried on a litter to the House of the Red
Branch, from which the flames were leaping, and before
which the dead lay in heaps.</p>

<p>And Conor besought him to help him to subdue
the Sons of Usna ere they should have slain every
Ultonian in the land. So by his magic Cathbad raised
a hedge of spears round the house. But Naoise, Ardan,
and Ainle, with Deirdr&ecirc; in their centre, sheltered by
their shields, burst suddenly forth from the blazing
house, and cut a way for themselves through the hedge
as though they sheared green wheat. And, laughing
aloud, they took a terrible toll of lives from the Ultonians
who would have withstood them. Then again
the Druid put forth his power, and a noise like the noise
of many waters was in the ears of all who were there.
So suddenly the magic flood arose that there was no
chance of escape for the Sons of Usna. Higher it
mounted, ever higher, and Naoise held Deirdr&ecirc; on his
shoulder, and smiled up in her eyes as the water rose
past his middle. Then suddenly as it had come, the
flood abated, and all was well with the Ultonians who
had sheltered on a rising ground. But the Sons of Usna
found themselves entrapped in a morass where the
water had been. Conor, seeing them in his hands at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg&nbsp;331]</a></span>
last, bade some of his warriors go and take them. But
for shame no Ultonian would go, and it was a man from
Norway who walked along a dry spit of land to where
they stood, sunk deep in the green bog. &ldquo;Slay me
first!&rdquo; called Ardan as he drew near, sword in hand.
&ldquo;I am the youngest, and, who knows, my death may
change the tides of fate!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Ainle also craved that death might be dealt
to him the first. But Naoise held out his own sword,
&ldquo;The Retaliator,&rdquo; to the executioner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mannanan, the son of L&icirc;r, gave me my good
sword,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;With it strike my dear brothers
and me one blow only as we stand here like three trees
planted in the soil. Then shall none of us know the
grief and shame of seeing the other beheaded.&rdquo; And
because it was hard for any man to disobey the command
of Naoise, a king of men, the Norseman reached
out his hand for the sword. But Deirdr&ecirc; sprang from
the shoulder of Naoise and would have killed the man
ere he struck. Roughly he threw her aside, and with
one blow he shore off the heads of the three greatest
heroes of Alba.</p>

<p>For a little while there was a great stillness there,
like the silence before the coming of a storm. And
then all who had beheld the end of the fair and noble
Sons of Usna broke into great lamentation. Only
Conor stood silent, gazing at the havoc he had wrought.
To Cuchulainn, the mighty champion, a good man and a
true, Deirdr&ecirc; fled, and begged him to protect her for
the little span of life that she knew yet remained to her.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg&nbsp;332]</a></span>
And with him she went to where the head of Naoise
lay, and tenderly she cleansed it from blood and from
the stains of strife and stress, and smoothed the hair
that was black as a raven&rsquo;s wing, and kissed the cold
lips again and again. And as she held it against her
white breast, as a mother holds a little child, she
chanted for Naoise, her heart, and for his brothers, a
lament that still lives in the language of the Gael.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Is it honour that ye love, brave and chivalrous Ultonians?<br /></span>

<p>Then, at the bidding of Cuchulainn, the Ultonian,
three graves were dug for the brothers, but the grave
of Naoise was made wider than the others, and when
he was placed in it, standing upright, with his head
placed on his shoulders, Deirdr&ecirc; stood by him and held
him in her white arms, and murmured to him of the
love that was theirs and of which not Death itself could
rob them. And even as she spoke to him, merciful
Death took her, and together they were buried. At
that same hour a terrible cry was heard: &ldquo;<em>The Red
Branch perisheth! Uladh passeth! Uladh passeth!</em>&rdquo; and
when he had so spoken, the soul of Cathbad the
Druid passed away.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg&nbsp;333]</a></span>
To the land of the Ultonians there came on the
morrow a mighty host, and the Red Branch was wiped
out for ever. Emain Macha was cast into ruins, and
Conor died in a madness of sorrow.</p>

<p>And still, in that land of Erin where she died, still in
the lonely cleuchs and glens, and up the mist-hung
mountain sides of Loch Etive, where she knew her truest
happiness, we can sometimes almost hear the wind sighing
the lament: &ldquo;Deirdr&ecirc; the beautiful is dead ... is
dead!&rdquo;</p>

<p><b>Transcriber's Note</b></p>

<p>Minor typographical errors (omitted punctuation, omitted or transposed letters, etc.)
have been amended without note. Inconsistent hyphenation and accent use has been
made consistent within the main text, again without note. Any inconsistencies between
quotations and the main text remain as printed.</p>

<p>There is a lot of archaic language in this text, which remains as printed. The
author also used alternative spelling in places (e.g. Epimethus rather than the
more usual Epimetheus); this remains as printed. There is a reference to Michael
Angelo on page <a href="#Page_203">203</a> and in the Index, by which the author
presumably meant Michelangelo; this has also been left as printed.</p>

<p>The following amendments have been made:</p>

<p class="blockquot">Page <a href="#Page_268">268</a>&mdash;were amended to
was&mdash;"... with Saragossa still unconquered was too much to hope for."</p>

<p class="blockquot">Page <a href="#Page_304">304</a>&mdash;Kemoc amended to
Larguen&mdash;"Then Larguen, in furious anger, ..."</p>

<p>Illustrations have been moved so that they are not in mid-paragraph. The frontispiece
illustration has been moved to follow the title page. Larger versions are
available; click on the image to see them.</p>

<p>Index entries have been made consistent with the main text, as follows:</p>

Pallas amended to Athen&eacute;, Pallas.</p>
